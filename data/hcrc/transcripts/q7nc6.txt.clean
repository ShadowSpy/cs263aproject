and have you you got a footbridge
and what you do is you go up and then you turn right and go along a couple of inches before you get to the footbridge

right so yo-- and you just like go along as if you're walking across the footbridge th-- the line goes along the footbridge
and it immediately drops straight down after that
okay
about an inch
and there's a p--
have you got a poisoned stream there
no right
well you have to go down about an inch and then along to your right
and have you got a temple
a good couple of inches to your right
well you go along down and then you curve up just before the seo the old temple
right and you go up about an inch above it
eh have you got anything to the left of that
