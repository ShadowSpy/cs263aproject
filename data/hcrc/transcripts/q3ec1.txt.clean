starting at the beginning head due south
you'll see a diamond mine on your map
avoid the diamond mine
going due south followed by east
east the right
no
south then east
we may have a different map
can you head due south
can you head due south
and can you then head to the right past the diamond mine
go for it
you'll see a graveyard
do you see a graveyard on your map to the right of the diamond mine
right
they've obviously not marked the graveyard
the graveyard is almost halfway in between
do you have carved stones
right
in between the diamond mine and the carved stones is the graveyard that's where it should be
so what you need to do is continue past the diamond mine then past where you think the graveyard is
yeah
go rou-- same under under the graveyard south of the graveyard
the graveyard's
correct
correct
s-- you then come no-- up north just to the left to the west of the carved stones
so if you're almost on top of carved stones then you'll totally miss the graveyard
that's correct
so you move east around carved stones
and then do you have gallows on your map
that's correct that's correct
all you need to do is go due south from the carved stones as far as you can see the gallows the same level as the gallows
you should be on top of the indian country correct
that's right
do you have a great rock
it's to the west of indian country
right
that's a different great rock
okay what you have to do is
now that you're paral-- parallel with the gallows right
you're on a level with the gallows
head southwest that's to the left and down past indian country
no
s-- straight southwest
not too far
do you see the gold mine
do you see the gold mine
uh-huh
i want you to go
west making sure that you remain above the gold mine
understand
so you go due west above the gold mine
but n-- not too far north 'cause otherwise you'll hit the rock so i want you to head just above the gold mine
are you above the gold mine now
just to the west of it
yeah
i want you to go just past it
so you're basically in the gap between the gallows and the gold mine
and i want you to go due sou--
do you have a trout farm
right
that's correct i think
want you to head due south as far south as the trout farm just below the trout farm
b-- just below the trout farm
and head east
ah do you have any other obstacles
in the way
well head due east just below the trout farm trying to avoid any obstacles on your way
right
now i've got a cavalry stockade on this map
no
cavalry it's a fort thing
so we need to avoid that
which means
it's almost south of the sou-- the trout farm it's south and slightly to the east
so i want you to go right past the trout farm almost to the edge of the map to make sure we miss it
so you're past your totem pole there as well you're
that's all right
right
i want you to go due south now
ehm do you have a cattle stockade
right
just below it you want to go round the bottom of it
uh-huh that's correct
i want you to go west below the stockade
although oh i don't have a river bed so
is your river bed
whereabouts is level becau--
uh-huh
correct
right
my map deviates here so i presume that's why you must have an obstacle
so what i want you to do is go west as far left as the sta-- s-- just the edge of the "c" of the s-- cattle stockade
then do you have to go up to avoid the
because that's how this map indicates
so i want you to go up not straight up ehm northwest
up up in a curve
i want you to go northwest in a one-er
uh-huh
it's a curve curve shape
curving up to the northwest followed by down to the southwest
s-- so i want you to go basically curve up and then down
no
not as far as that
only a small curve
to about the m-- the middle of the fencing of the sto-- the cattle stockade
northwest to the left of the page
uh-huh that's correct
'cause presumably we must be avoiding the river is that correct
and then we go due west along the bottom under the bandit territory
and then curve round and up to the finish
do you have finish on your map
right
keep going past the bandit terri-- territory
are due west of the bandit territory yet
right
continue until you're about an inch two inches away from the edge of the page
and curve up to it the point just above the s-- cactus of the bandit terri-- territory
understand
so on the level
no
the level of it but about an inch two inches in from the page
understand what i mean
correct
and that's your "x" that's your finish
