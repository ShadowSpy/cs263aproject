your start and you've got a diamond mine beside it
and you've got a fast flowing river over the other corner
right
so if you just circle round the diamond mine
and have you got a graveyard in the middle no of the fast flowing river and the diamond mine
no
just
down no
you're circling you're going down no just circling round it so that you end up with a horizontal line below the diamond mine you know circling round it
uh-huh
that's the way you're going
and it
mmhmm
right and er
i've got on my map i've got a graveyard in between them both exactly in between
right so
if you imagine
that you have to circle round the graveyard you know to the right-hand side below and then round
get that
so you're like really going just about vertically along to the right you know to where you imagine the graveyard is and you're going round it but then you're you're going round it then you're ehm going to your right above the fast flow-- the fast flowing river
no
you're going below the graveyard and above the fast flowing river
if you can imagine that know
ah you're circling round it
right
and then you're going vertically downwards
have you got
have you got an apache camp
right
well you're going downwards and but you're going to the left of the apache camp so you're going vertically downwards and then your line's sort of going left
and have you got a carved wooden pole no
that's just that's in the cen-- in the centre of the page just above the ac-- apache camp though
so
you have to avoid that so you're going down sort of
uh-huh
well
you've to go past that
towards the centre of the page though
to
no
this is a curve a forty-five degree line i would say you know like you're from the the bottom of the fast flowing river
right
you're maybe coming down about an inch and a half vertically
and then it sort of curves at a forty-five degree line
to the middle of the page you know in line with the apache camp i would say
right
where are they
right
so
have you got a walled city
where's is that
mmhmm
just below the apache camp you know
well
more level
well
you're you're coming right sort of you're going round the top of the walled city
right so you've passed the apache pa-- you're above the apa-- apache camp and you're going round the top of the walled city
right
and then you're sort of curving just curving basically it's kind of vertically you're going for a vertical kind of curve if you can say that for about maybe four inches down to you're coming down to about the bottom third of the page
a ghost town
no
where's that where's the ghost town
uh-huh right
so
you're pur-- you're circling round the ghost town
uh-huh
under-- well yes uh-huh
i would imagi--
and then you've got flat rocks over to the right-hand side
is that kind of maybe just a wee bit above the ghost town
right
and you've got a stone creek below
so you're sort of going in between the two
you're curving round 'til nearly you're nearly up at the flat rocks
your curve's going a way up
right
and then you're going vertically down again you should be maybe just less than an inch off the right-hand side of the page
right
where's that
no
i've got a stone creek
have well have you
right
so you've to go past the flat rocks you know below but you've to go over 'til you're really about an inch the from right-hand side of the page
and then down again
uh-huh
ehm take it
have you got buffalo
just you're curving round the buffalo
you're going vertically down then curving round the buffalo
uh-huh underneath
right
and then you've got a fort to the left-hand side at the bottom
and you've got the buffalo well in between i've got a cattle ranch
you haven't
right so like
what you've really got to do is avoid the cattle ranch
which is really like in between the buffalo and the fort
so what you have to do is go r-- circle round the buffalo and then go above the cattle ranch if you can imagine it there
right
do a bump it's in the centre of
and then you're going down below the fort
curving round below the fort that's at the bottom of the page
and then you're just curving up and the finish is maybe two inches from the bottom of the page up
that's it
