we're
starting down at the bottom right-hand corner nearly
ha-- have you got crest falls
well directly above them maybe about three quarters of an inch above there is the start point
eh
go along to the the left
there's no banana tree in this one
uh-huh
well say the top's north and
go west
eh
until you've just got past the edge of the crest falls
and then
come down until you reach a an angle maybe just past south towards west slightly past until you reach the bottom of crest falls and le-- a level with the "c" and maybe about an inch to west of the "c"
right
and then go due west until about two centimetres from the edge of the paper
now
do you have a footbridge
right
go up north now until you're just due north until you're just below the the level of the footbridge
and then from there go over right to the edge of the the the western side of footbridge
right
and then the path s-- the path starts again at the other side of the footbridge
now
do you have a poisoned stream there
well
just at the the footbridge next to when you come off there's a poisoned stream
so when you come off the footbridge you have to go due south maybe about an inch and a half
uh-huh
and then
och t-- take a wee bit more to be safe just a wee touch more
and then do you have an old temple
right
go along eastward for about two inches
and then curve up until you're at the bottom of the old temple
mmhmm
now
go up about two and a half inches
do you have anything above the old temple in that area up there
right
what about do you have an abandoned truck
uh-huh
is there anything between the old temple and the truck
right
i don't have that
ehm
loo-- go two and a half inches up over the temple the up the side of it
and then
and then say an angle of northwest forty-five degrees
go up for about two inches that would probably take you past the top of the
something uh-huh
and then b-- back down at the same angle to well the opposite angle anyway to get you down to th-- your abandoned truck just below it
and then go straight across the bottom of the abandoned truck
until you're just below the "a"
now
have you got baboons
right
now come due south
about an inch and a half to an inch and three quarters
and then
due west for about two inches
uh then
do you have a white mountain further up
right
now
well the best thing to do first of all would be come back up to where you were at the "a" and the come up to make that a "u" shape
and then
draw a line straight between this point and maybe about half a centimetre to the west of the bottom of the white mountain
right
now mm
go up the side of the mountain until you're maybe follow the side for up until about half an inch below the summit
and then change to going due north for about three inches
ah there's no lemon grove in this one
right
is there a pyramid
yeah
now
this'll be you just about a third of the way up the pyramid
and then straight across until about a centimetre to the west of the pyramid
no
straight across until
on the same level
and then mm go up over the top of the pyramid and in a a cone sort of a a triangle shape and down the other side until you're at the base of the pyramid
right
do you have a cobbled street
right
below the pyramid there's a cobbled street and
ehm it's below the western side of the pyramid
now
from where you are just now draw a curved line 'til you're below the "d" of pyramid
and then straight across until you're just below the point of the pyramid at the western tip
right
go at an angle slightly more slightly to the west of south
to avoid the cobbled street there
and do you have a remote village
and just to where the the thick lines at the remote village drawing are
just about a centimetre to the west of the l-- thick line and stop there
now
curve round draw a curve until you're below the "r" of remote
and then
straight across until you're below the "e"
the "e" in village sorry
and then
go straight across another inch and that's the finish
