ten inches get away i don't know if i'd say that
do you have the abandoned truck

well see ah about an inch above the abandoned truck that is where you should be
now are y--
go straight across to the abandoned truck and then come south so that you're just underneath it
go to your left 'til you're uh ah until you're level and then south so that you're just underneath it you should be above it
you go to your left obviously yes 'cause that's where the abandoned truck is now south so that you're just underneath it and just go to the end of the abandoned truck
now do you have baboons
stop after you reach the aba-- just just right after you've gone under it
