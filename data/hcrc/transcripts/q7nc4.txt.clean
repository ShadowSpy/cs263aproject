right okay ehm right
have you got a start point right down near the bot-- oh shit down near the bottom of the page which is above a crest falls
right
the start point's at about a half an inch above it
okay right
oh right
what we need to do right is like eh
above that you've roughly well above and to a wee bit to the left you've got s-- a poison stream is that right
uh-huh
have you got anything to-- more to the left at all
right okay
right we need to go t-- right what we need to do is like see the crest falls we need to go like we start just above it and we move to the ehm
i'll explain it to you right first
move to the left about an inch and then drop down like almost at the side of the falls
it goes into a curve d-- goes along the bottom of the page right to about an inch before the edge of the page and it curves right round it's almost like a kind of square circle and it cuts along and it goes it goes up level with the footbridge and goes along the footbridge
okay
yeah
like as if you're walking along the footbridge
right
and then it jus--
oh
i don't have a banana tree
where's the banana tree roughly
in
right
right okay
well w-- what we want to kind of go round that the round the outside of that one a massive big curve
okay
right
right you ju-- if you go right to the footbridge
just sort aye if you if you think
if its alright right
right
just ri-- right down to the bottom of it really
and then
along the bottom and then curve up right round past banana tree
right
right up to the point level with the footbridge
eh well you actually need to go across it
right yeah as if
you're walking along it
is that okay
right see once you've come like if you stop just at the side of the foo-- just at the other edge of the footbridge
okay
and we've got a poisoned stream right next to that on the right-hand side
so we need to drop down about an inch and a half straight down after the footbridge
yeah straight down
'cause it's right next to it as if we're dropped down between it
okay
eh drop down about an inch inch and a half
and then we need to eh go to your your right about two or three inches
yeah now we're
what's with the old temple right we're going to curve up like ehm curve to go straight up like just before the old temple
yeah
so you're like glancing round it so you just go go in a curve down
yeah
but if you make it a curve instead of like a ti-- a sort of tight angle there
right
and go about an inch above the old temple just going straight up
yeah
to the left-hand side of the old temple
okay
aye about that
right eh
there's a kind of hump
right
have you got see to the left of where you are right have you got an abandoned truck a good bit to the left
right well
i've got a massive big hump here so i i presume that goes round the str-- s-- round the top of the slate mountain
if you want to draw like draw a curve round the top of the slate mountain and go down underneath the abandoned truck
no
just underneath the writing
okay and stop just at the end of the writing abandoned truck
okay
right
have you got down to your bottom left-hand side of where you are a baboons
right okay
so
what we oh heck it's right there's a there's this kind of group of baboons right which is right near the edge but we need to kind of go down underneath them and along to about a half an inch before the edge of the page and then up again so it's like a cup-shaped
thing really
you're going down about an inch below the abandoned truck
right see right
you're underneath the abandoned truck just now
is that right
and you need to sort of curve straight down to about an about an inch just over an inch below that and straight down a-- and sort of round along for about an inch and then up for about an inch so it's like a cup-shaped
to the left
yeah
and just before the paper say about a half an inch before the paper curve up again
okay
right so
have you got quite a couple of inches above that a thing called white mountain
right
now we sort of gently slope to the right from where we are up to the left-hand side of the white mountain so you sort of
no
just along the side of it along the left-hand side of the mountain
okay
and then after you to-- the top of the mountain you go straight up for three inches
well i don't have a lemon only
right
well maybe go ab-- right if y-- if you avoid that and once you get to the top of that turn right like a sort of right angle turning to the right if you see what i mean
right
uh-huh
and about two and a half inches along from there th-- have you got a pyramid
right
we have to go round the outside of the pyramid but you go up-- up the left-hand side down the right-hand side and underneath it right so we're almost doing a triangle
but underneath that we've got a cobbled street
have you got that
oh no like my poisoned stream's a lot more to the right but i've got a cobbled street right underneath the pyramid
right so
have you have you drawn round the pyramid yet
right
if you could go along back to your left right to the end of the pyramid
yeah
so it's almost as if you're drawing right round it but not quite
yeah uh-huh
right excuse me coughing right
we've got have you got a remote village further down
right okay now
what we have to do is sort of veer to the left just a wee bit going straight down so that you come down underneath the remote village right and once you get to the
you know on the left-hand side of it
okay
and then what we need to do is turn turn right straight right f-- just 'til you're other side of the remote village and then that's us done
well eh mine's is in a different position than yours so
aye probably if yours is
yeah
but you come round the left-hand side underneath it and along to your right
okay
yeah
roughly just yeah say maybe just just short of that
okay
right
yeah
you put a big cross and your name on it and that
