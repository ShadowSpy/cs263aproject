right you start at the top left
right
eh right
right you've got cliffs to the right so you sort of slope down towards the "c" of cliffs
right
and then underneath the you don't have a forge underneath the cliff what is there nothing
oh
oh
right well go right
right
are they quite big right are the sandstone s-- cliffs beside the old pine tree
right okay
ah the cliffs right okay right okay
right
right see underneath the cliffs on my map there's a forge
right
and that's directly underneath the cliffs so it if
yeah
so just pretend there's a a forge
but it's like but to the left of the pine tree and below the cliffs right so it's like a loop
okay
so you're ending up just like to the left of the old pine tree
oh it's upside down
my crane bay's at the bottom right
i haven't got one
right okay then right
well that's fine
right
so just go up round the top of the old pine and stop at the top of it
right
and then eh make the line go across page you know to the right
about that much
right
just straight across
that's right two or three centimetres
right
then have you got a pine forest on the right
yeah
right
slope down towards the "p" of pine forest
no no
just keep the pine forest at it outwith it
right
and then below that what've you got
right so you
right i haven't got a forest stream right so
uh-huh
right
so like you've got to eventually right see from the "p" of the pine forest you're going to go out in a sort of wee lump like a nose
no
but right first before you come to the bakery do another wee lump
'cause i say
nothing
just that's where the route goes
so you do a wee lump and then that comes in just maybe above the wee shed in the bakery
see where the shed is in the bakery right
then you do a big nose round the bakery right right underneath the bakery
and you don't stop underneath the bakery you continue in for another two centimetres
right
right i've got a canal there
have you
right okay
right see after your two centimetres you should be above
have you got crane bay
above the "e" in crane bay
right
so you go down towards "e"
down to the coast
right
then you follow the coastline round
just eh about two centimetres
towards there's a sort of a wee and then then then the bay starts sloping down
vertically right just about where about where it slopes down
right
and then eh have you got wheatfields to the left of that
no
sort of in line with the "n" and the "e" of crane bay
oh right okay
well i have right
so just go down
have you got a w-- rocket warehouse
right go slope down and then above right you slope down to maybe two centimetres above the rocket warehouse and two centimetres in from the bay just say in line with the "c"
right a wee diagonal line there
and then you go horizontally across the top of the rocket warehouse
to just to the edge of the rocket warehouse
and then you slope the line down onto the edge of the page about s-- five centimetres up from the bottom
i don't have a cave
right
so like
well almost
right
and then you go down go down the edge of the page right
the last guy had a cave as well but he went round the bottom of it
so like just go round the bottom of the cave and then up to the old lighthouse end up at the old lighthouse
just beside it
uh-huh
okay
