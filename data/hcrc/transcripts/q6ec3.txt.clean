okay ehm
have you got a starting point above the missionary camp
and have you got gorillas
well
they're in the bottom left-hand corner
roughly up a bit huh
of the map
right okay
so
if you just go left from the missionary camp a bit and then down
yeah
to about a couple of centimetres above the top of the bottom of the page
and then continue straight left along until about four centimetres from the end and then go straight up again
sorry
yeah probably yeah
uh do you have a rope bridge
yeah
uh-huh yeah
right
mmhmm
okay that's fine
now
you've got the rope bridge
so that you want to come up the page and then just when you're about in line with the rope rope bridge just turn right so you're across it
yeah
okay
if you now come down a couple of centimetres
and do you have a waterfall
yeah
if you just
mm do you have a sort of the water coming down
if you sort of head along
so that you're about in line with the bottom of the water
if you know what i mean
and then
have you got lost steps
okay
if you just get to the waterfall first
and then you want to go straight up to where these lost steps are
well
have you got fallen pillars
it's sor-- it's
in the finishing point
no
ehm it's about in line with the fallen pillars
to the right of them
in between the rope bridge and the waterfall
uh-huh
well you want to go straight up
and you've got the lost steps
so--
uh
if you go straight up from the waterfall you keep going up until you're in line with the fallen pillars
but don't actually go near them
and that's you if you sort of curve off to the left
you'll miss the lost steps
um to about just before the middle of the page
and then you want to come down in a diagonal
so that you've missed the fallen pillars and go underneath them
right just keep going 'til the end
of the fallen pillars
yeah
um now go down two or three centimetres
do you have an obstacle there
well uh
i think you're probably trying to avoid that so if you go down um and then left in a sort of curve
and up again and you're pretty near the edge of the page
then
do you have ancient ruins
yeah
okay
just like a bit up from the fallen pillars and to the left
well
you want to sort of come towards the ancient ruins a bit
without actually coming into contact with them
a straight line
yeah
yeah
now
do you have stones in the top left
no no it's okay
now if you just uh
at the top there's some stones and that's about four centimetres from the top
yeah
to about four centimetres
and then you want to go sharp right
to about halfway across the page
now
do you have a white mountain
you want to just go over the top of that and round
mmhmm
yeah okay
um do you have a soft furnishings store
eh right um you're quite close to the mountain at the moment on its right-hand side
well if you
under directly underneath the mountain about three centimetres down there's a soft furnishings store
so you want to come down from the mountain and turn sharp left
so that you're sort of in line with the left-hand side of the mountain
then you come straight down and right
do you have gazelles
underneath them
the right-hand side
to about the right-hand side of the mountain level if you know what i mean
okay
that's it
yeah
that's right
