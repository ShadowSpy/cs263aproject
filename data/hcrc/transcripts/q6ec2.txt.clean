um are you at the start
um move downwards on the map so that the telephone kiosk you're to the left of the telephone kiosk
and continue to move downwards until you are para-- level with the stone circle
you don't have a stone circle
okay
do you have a stone circle on the map at all
fine
um do you have any obstacle below the telephone kiosk
a brok--
a broken gate
directly below the telephone kiosk
do you have anything directly below the telephone kiosk no
move downwards
until move completely move downwards until you're almost at the bottom of the paper
uh-huh
are you downwards until you're almost at the bottom of the paper
then move right along not comple-- for if you want it in inches about four inches
yeah
but that's farther along
not that far along
no no no no no
move when you have gone down from the telephone kiosk and you're almost at the bottom of the paper
move in inches about three inches along the map
okay
now move
do you have a farmer's gate upwards from where you are at the moment
broken yeah
but it says farmer's gate or does it say broken gate
okay fine
move upwards an-- so that you're to the left of the broken gate
and just level to the gatepost
to the gate yeah
yeah
well i wasn't sure about the distance
okay
now you are at the left of the gatepost
and if you see what i mean standing at the top of it yeah ehm
no
ah if as long as you're um next to the gatepost to the left that's fine
um now
on this map if you were to move upwards slightly and to the right and then once you'd moved to the right 'til about three quarters along the paper
and then move upwards
you would come to a ruined monastery
is that the same
no
okay
yeah
well it doesn't exist on mine so
you just have to move round okay
you just you just have to move round okay now move
right
i'll explain what to do before you do it
but on your map you'll have to avoid the youth hostel
because i don't have one on mine
don't you think
anyway
okay eh
i'll just relay mine
okay
now you're at
you're at the broken gate
don't move thr-- through the broken gate
p-- 'cause i don't
okay
so
wha-- what does your obstacle look like
the gate
what's it look like
so it's it's basically two posts with a broken gate
okay
and you're standing to the left of the left-hand post
yep well
move up until you're slightly clear of the gatepost if you see what i mean
no
i didn't realise that there was a wall
mine doesn't have a wall
okay
well just
basically jump over the wall yeah
okay
now move right
and move along to about three quarters along the way of the paper
now
on my map if you were to move straight up until slightly higher than halfway up the paper
there's a ruined monastery
now
move around the ruined monastery to the left
and then move
do you have any obstacles between the monastery and the lake
the lake is slightly lo-- the lake is lower down the lake is lower down than the monastery is
it is on this one yeah
oh i see
i have a west lake which is on the east actually but never mind
yeah okay
do you have a stile
you do have a stile
now is the s--
it's
it's above and to the left of the monastery
okay
now move over the top of the monastery if you see what i mean in relation to the paper
no no well
go back and move over the top
and then move left and upwards 'til you come to the stile
i'm not sure how that's going to aff-- affect your lake
well
you could move aro-- you could move around and down in a sort of circular if you like you don't have to move diagonally
yeah i suppose
i suppose
don't tire yourself out erm
now move
directly upwards until you're clear of the stile much the same way as you did with the gate
yeah
and then move
do you have any obstacles between the stile and the dead tree
do you have a dead tree
no r--
in relation to the
so where are you at the moment
above the stile that's fine
now
if level with the stile on the extreme right-hand side there's a dead tree
well
that's dead isn't it
why
it wouldn't be a dutch elm then
fine okay you've got a tree
now
i'll just have to relay the route on the map
okay
move left from where you are at the moment so that you're above the stile but stop when you get past the stile
okay ehm
you're above the stile
now move in a move right so that when you s-- so that you stop just after the stile finishes
ehm
you're bloody useless
are you
told you
why aren't you on the left of it
well
you ought to have gone to the left of it
okay
i'm saying now
yeah
go to the left
okay
then move upwards and to the right
and stop when the stile stops
okay
yeah i know
but but at least you've gone round the stile
and there might be a monster who inhabits the right-hand of the stile you don't know
now right
now move straight up until you're about three quarters
well
we're coming to that in a minute
so
move three quarters upwards in relation
to the entire map
well
don't move very much then
a poplar
no
well well
if the maps may not be the same presumably you're we're going to have to avoid these obstacles
yeah
yeah
i've actually got two great viewpoints
you can have my map if you want two i'm i'm not very keen on great viewpoints
um ah
so the great viewpoint's in the way
four inches up and slightly to the left
uh-huh
where are you at the moment
above the stile
on this map there's a a sort of a bump basically in in the route
yeah
no no no
well like a hill except yeah i suppose
what i mean by that is there's a bump in the route there isn't a bump on the map
right
now move right and down in a sort of circular sweep until you get to the dead tree
and then move around a-- and
oh on the right side of the tree i want you to finish up on the right side of the tree
then move up and left and up so that you're to the right of the great viewpoint when you finish
assuming that your great viewpoint's in the same place as mine
ah
i have two great viewpoints
okay tuba ehm
go back until you're right of the dead tree
right
do you have a lake to the top
to the top that's fine
now
below the east lake
there's a great viewpoint as well
well
that probably
similar
yeah
fine
so if you can move
where is the rocket launch pad in relation to the lake
beneath the lake on the right side
mm
how can it be beneath the lake and on the right
nope
oh i see
oh
well
the great viewpoint that i have is below the lake and if there was a midline through the lake it would be probably s-- s-- very slightly to the left of the midline
if you go upwards and stop below the bottom of the lake so that you're about two thirds along the length of the lake
okay
now
if you move left and along the bottom of the lake until the lake finishes
no
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
you went up
up along to the left and then up
along the lake
from the left of the lake two thirds along
i see
no you want to be two thirds along from the left
yeah
now wh--
where you are from where you are at the moment if you were
if you move
left and along the base of the lake
until the lake finishes
yeah
now
you ought to be standing at the
no
you ought to be standing
if the lake continued down if the edge of the lake wasn't curved
yeah
then you ought to be standing at the extreme left edge of the lake
you are
well
that's you finished
