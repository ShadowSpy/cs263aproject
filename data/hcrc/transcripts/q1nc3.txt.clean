right
well the start is
ah is it the same
mmhmm
so you're going vertically downwards about
eh
where are we finishing
uh-huh
a walk city
yes
but it's further down the page
uh-huh
there's a desert
on the left-hand side uh-huh
underneath
to the left
no
you're going vertically downwards past the diamond mine
you know just c-- you're curving just curving round the diamond
mine uh-huh
uh-huh
well do
have you got a graveyard sort of in the middle of the page on a level to the c-- er diamond mine
a fast flowing river eh
where is that
the diamond mine is that on the right-hand side of your page
ah
the fast flowing river is at the top
right that's i've got that
ehm i've got uh-huh
carved wooden pole
er that's the s-- that's the apache camp
ss
mmhmm
curve underneath
have you got s-- see between the fast flowing river and the diamond mine have you got anything
right so
i've got a graveyard there
eh really just right in the middle of the two the fast flowing mine fast flowing river and the diamond mine
uh-huh
you've to miss the graveyard so if you
right you've curved round right
mmhmm
so
if you go o--
well just start slightly going up the way
and right
imagine there's a graveyard
right
right
just in the centre of the diamond mine
and the fast flowing river just imagine that
right
and you j-- you're going round that you're going round the graveyard
no
below it
mmhmm
so you're sort of curving round to the graveyard
right
you're going round the graveyard
uh-huh
i know you don't
right
it's just
just imagine it's the same size as the diamond mine and the fast flowing river i-- right but it's parked in the middle
so
if mmhmm
you've to you're going round the top of the fast flowing river after you've avoided the graveyard
uh-huh mmhmm
well right
you go round
then
no
oh uh-huh i've got an apache camp
it's maybe
mmhmm
i don't
uh-huh
so if you right
in line with the fast flowing river if you come down maybe one and a half inches
eh have you got a carved wooden pole
oh right
and where's your apache camp
mmhmm
yeah that's right
so if you like c-- curve round the
no
don't curve round it j--
just you're going m-- forty-five degree angle eh towards the bottom eh left of the page you're going that way you know
uh-huh
and you're going round the outside of the walled city
you're going round the top of the walled city and round the left of it on the left-hand side
no
no
yes
you've come down about one and a half inches
right so
if you do it then do a forty-five degree line for maybe about three inches 'til you're probably in line with the top of the walled city
that height what you're you've to come down the middle of the page take the forty-five degree line down to the middle of the page
right
no not the mi-- the centre no not
uh-huh
that's right
uh-huh
so now you've got to take it take your line to the left 'til you come into
uh-huh
yes
mmhmm
the walled city is just above the cen-- halfway up the page right
and you've you've just curved round that
and how far is it away from the left-hand side of the page
that's fine
so if you've i-- yeah you've curved round
right
are you in line with the bottom of the walled city
no
right
just take it down there so i can tell you how many more inches to go down
uh-huh just there yeah
so uh-huh
no
you're going straight down
in a slight curve you're taking it down maybe about to as far as a a third of the way up the page
you're com--
uh-huh
just a very slight curve you know really just about vertically you're going down
so right
now
no
oh i've got another carved wooden pole down the page as well
uh-huh
and the flat rocks i've
in the middle of the page
ah halfway up i mean
to the right
yes
at the v--
uh-huh
you should be about an inch and a half above that though shouldn't be down that far yet
uh-huh
oh have you
i don't have anything
right
well you should curve just you you'll have to go below the
uh-huh
right just curve round it
and have you got a stone creek
where's that
is that about a third of the way u-- up the page
right
well you're going above that
and you're going up to where the flat rocks are you're just curving up
you're avoiding the stone creek in but you're below the flat rocks just very close to the flat rocks
uh-huh
so it's just like a c--
uh-huh
it's like a curve
and then
so if you take your line to the end of the flat rocks
then you're going
no
mmhmm
that's down at the bottom right
well
what you're doing is you're you should be about an in-- an inch off the end of the page
the right
so you're just it's a vertical line basically down eh
round the b-- the buffalos
uh-huh
uh-huh
below the buffalo
right
so have you got a cattle ranch
have you got anyth--
have you got anything there
well
if you right you've curved round below the buffalo
if you just maybe imagine there's a cattle ranch there
right
just after the buffalo
between the fort uh-huh
and it's more in line with the fort
right
so you know how you've curved round
where the buffalos are
you've you'll have to you know
do a bump
in your route
uh mmhmm
bump in your route and then round to the fort
and the finish is above the fort maybe about an inch above the fort
on the left-hand side
mmhmm
on the left-hand side you've
uh-huh
you know you've got to go below the fort
yes
it's in line with the carved wooden pole except it's an inch from the
no
an inch from the left-hand side of the page
is that you
no
it's above
'bout an inch above the fort
that's it
