right
you got a map with an extinct volcano
right
right
you've got a cross marked start
right
if you just want to come like down past the extinct volcano down to like to towards the bottom of the page
uh-huh just straight down
uh south
south down to about equal to where the tribal settlement is further on
just a wee bit below it because you're going to go start going ehm west you
y-- you've not got a t--
you've not got
you've not got to the left-hand side a tribal settlement
well you're going to go down about three centimetres down to where it the word says extinct volcano
okay
then you're going to start going along west
right
keep on going until you're maybe about three centimetres from the the left-hand side of the page
uh-huh it's quite far along
'kay
so just about three in-- three centimetres from the left-hand side
okay
then you're going to start going up north
right
have you got a rope bridge
uh-huh
so if you start just drawing drawing a line up towards the rope bridge
uh-huh
just going up then veering off to the right up to the rope bridge
then you're going to go across the rope bridge
uh-huh
you're going to go through that

you're at the end of the rope bridge
now if you go down not very steeply but just ehm down south a bit
about about another three centimetres just a gradual slope down
uh-huh
uh-huh slope to the east

right
so now you want to go east
straight across
just a straight line
for about
have you got a collapsed shelter
right
you're going to go along until you're underneath the collapsed shelter
but
uh-huh just a little below the "o" actually
okay
then you're going to start going up north again
and put your line through the "o"
and you're going to go up there for about about ehm let me see about ten centimetres up
i've not got a crevasse
uh-huh ten centimetres straight up north
right
and then you're going to actually you're not just going to go ehm when you go st-- you're going to go back west again but if you actually kind of go up a wee bit then diagonally down know what i mean like in a wee hump

and then continue going west it's just straight across
for about three centimetres so you're kind of l--
uh-huh this is towards the edge of the paper
so you're making another little kind of you're making a wee pit and now you're going to go back up again
you're going to go up north well this is quite a long way this time about about twelve centimetres right up north up the side of the page
and have you got a white mountain
aye we're about a third down the page
and you're going to go up to about two thirds up the page with this line
oh you've got the white mountain
well you see how like the white mountain's jagged on the left-hand side
like if you just kind of like veer your line as though you're going up the moun-- the white mountain
uh-huh up the side of the white mountain
and right once you reach the top of the white mountain
with your line just continue straight up north
have you got a golden beach
well the golden beach is about six centimetres up so if you
this is direct--
this is directly up north
a straight line up to the golden beach
from the top of the white mountain right up
ehm about six centimetres 'til you're about ah 'til you're about ehm about the same distance away from you're about five centimetres six centimetres from the top of the page now
right
to the left-hand side of the page
right
and now we're going to go a complete straight line ehm east
for about six centimetres again 'cause if you
ah th--
right 'til it's just the bottom of slate mountain that'll be then
okay
and see how you what you did with the white mountain ehm
you you just went up the side
well look as though you're going to climb the up to the top of the slate mountain
then come back down the other side missing the wee seagulls

do you know what i mean
okay
you're going to come as though you're just going up the top you're coming back the way you've come
uh-huh yeah
round to the left-hand side of the page again
that'd be west
and then once you reach about the as though the the bottom of the slate mountain again you're going to go competely down to the bottom of the secret valley
just directly down
uh-huh just to the bottom of the where it says secret valley
and then can you see you just draw a straight line to the finish
well the finish is actually
you know where it says secret valley
it's just about a centimetre along from that and down a wee bit that's where the f--
