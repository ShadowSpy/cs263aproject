right
top left sandy shore
down at the bottom of it bottom left of it follow the s-- line stream i presume it is to the top of the well
you don't have a stream
right
do you have a well
no
right
right okay
now down slightly to
slightly sloped slightly sloped that way
right
east
but don't go down too far
uh-huh
and then
you don't have a well
right
so before does your stream turn to the right
you don't have anything
yes
do you have anything
is your page just blank
okay
right down about three centimetres
and then slightly to the east that way and then turn to the west and like curve round like that except it'll be the other way
and then
after you finish the curve continue to the east
do you have a house with local residents
yeah
the big river
no
no
no
mm
treasure
a pirate ship at the bottom bottom left
yeah
above the hills
to the east of that
nearly to the end of the hills
no
we're just going east
have you passed like have you done the curvy bit
right
and then sort of curve on to the east along the east
ten centimetres
east
to about couple centimetres off the top off the end of the hills
and
then curve upwards
back to the stream to where you c-- to where you cross the stream
do you have like two black lines and then a big stream
uh-huh
right
s--
you've got crane bay
at the top
uh
right
and you've got like the two bits round two lines round crane bay
so you cross that go up go back up and cross that
about two centimetres from where the two lines meet more sort of come into one
right
i've got i've got my forked stream on the page
right
have you got something saying forked stream
right now go up to the left from that
right
okay
follow the stream up
yeah i know
list-- i know this is me explaining what i've got
on the page
right
and then when it gets to the top one bit of the stream goes up and one bit goes left and up
it round crane bay
no
i don't have a bridge but maybe that's your bridge then that's how it's crossed
you got a bridge
how many centimetres off the top of the page
yeah that could be it
yeah
so have i
mmhmm
go up
no
round the round to the le-- the left of the house
and up to probably where your bridge is then
right
and then you go right
over the bridge
well i don't know i don't have the bridge but it looks over the bridge
have you another bridge no
up near where that one is no
well keep going right for about four centimetres
do you have a wood
you're roughly in line with the wood or slightly
sort of nearly the middle of the wood but not quite down a bit
in the middle
right
now go down and round the forked stream
round the forked stream 'til you come to like about the "m" in stream
now
do you have farmed land
do you have a dead tree
right in like where two streams meet you have a dead tree
right
to the right of that across the stream there's a big bit of farmed land
right
about seven or eight centimetres along
so what you've got to do now is like go round that
no
round the farmed land
way out 'til about
yeah
to about two centimetres off the end the page
then about four centimetres down
and then back in again
so you're just below the dead tree
and then you cross the stream so's that you are actually below the dead tree
neither do i
right
do you have pine grove
do you have a lagoon
about the middle
mm right
from where you are below the dead tree go straight down 'til you're in line with the lagoon
which i don't have
and then go west 'til you nearly reach the lagoon
right
and then down round that to the bottom the tip of the lagoon
right now
do you have a rock fall
right you have green bay
do you have ehm
right
green bay is a bay right see the top point of green bay the outer point
yeah
westerly point the top the end bit of land
that like comes to a point right
yeah mmhmm
right
so you come from the bottom of the lagoon and you're wanting to go there but the wee
if you look in the top line of green bay there's like a wee dent in it
that's a rock fall of about three centimetres high
so you have to come from the bottom of the lagoon over that and then down to the tip
'kay
now
just like cur--
do you have a pirate ship
right yeah and
you're meant to finish just at the front of the pirate ship so just like curve round
yeah
the the west the front
and that's you
