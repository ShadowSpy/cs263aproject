right ready
okay
go n-- start at start
do you have a start
do you have you're at start
okay
um alright
go directly south but make the shape of a little camel's hump direct--
directly south
say you know
the nor--
just just on your way south make a little hump
and go down about oh three inches
just like a wee little like a little hill
just like the well the three inch line going south should just be like a little just have a little a hump to
it does
pardon yeah yeah
sort of j-- well well just with one but i d-- i guess it doesn't matter so just go down south about three inches
then go
east about two inches
mm
and then go
or maybe no just go east about one inch
no
no
we're trying to avoid one
so
there so what we want to do now well we should have gone
um
we'll see
okay because
yeah to the right
yeah
but so
now we want to go um diagonally northeast and sort of avoid the obstacle on the right so you should be on the outside of that
c--
carpenter
okay
and so now
we're right below the green bay
do you have that
okay anyway s--
north yeah
yeah
about two inches maybe
i don't know really inches that well
okay
so
now we want to go to the right which is to the east
so
yeah
well we want to of this is what i okay well let's see
we want to go st-- east east about two inches
and then sort of slope down about two inches and approach the left of these trees
to to come in below
yeah yeah the left of the trees
and then
ah well
it has to go east right about two inches and then come down about an inch and a half
so
it it doesn't go directly from it's sort of like more like a slope
mmhmm
you mean "zee"
"zed" okay
so now so he-- alright
here we are
so now
there's another little obstacle
and ah
well
well
there were trees that we just
got by and now
yeah yeah
that's exactly where you should be
but now is there something even be-- right below the trees
okay well
yeah that's we're above there we're halfway
okay
we're right at the bottom of the trees right
and what we want to do is
what we want to do
is make like alright
say you're at the bottom of the seven beeches
you want to take your index finger and do like a semicircle right from there to the top of the fields just like a sort of a
yeah yeah
a s-- eh half a curve though
just so it's like a curve to the right and it's only that
and s--
if you put your left index finger and just go to the right
and it's like a half semicircle half circle
okay so now
we're at the top
fields yeah
and then like
say say you put your thumb
put your left thumb right over the fields and then trace around it
put put y--
no no
your left i'm doing it with my left hand
put okay
put your put your left thumb just so the tip of your thumb is facing right is facing east
and then just put it over the fields and then like trace around your thumb 'til the base or 'til the base of the thumb where it connects to the rest of the hand
okay
why not
yeah
just well just use the right thing 'cause all you need to do is trace around your thumb
well
it should be you sh-- your thumb should be directly on the fields and then you should be going around it
yeah yeah
and then to where the base
ah your hands are much smaller than mine
yeah you go right around the fields
and then you go left again to the base of your thumb
'cause it looks like it looks like a hand sort of well my thumb's a lot bigger than yours
okay so
now
i know it's cool
alright um
now we want to go due south
for about two inches
and come right along to the edge of the bay
and then s--
yeah like about
no
just like leaving a wee space
in between
and then
does the bay sort of slope down to the left
you
yeah
yeah
just trace along that curve
'til you come to the next wee point
where it sort of 'cause then then like the bay drops down
so
just where the bay drops down stop there
okay and now
what we want to do is like a little waterfall sort of
like
do you have
directly to your left do you have like cliffs and with a meadow on top of it
yeah
and then do you have anything ahead of it on top of
that okay
okay
v-- but that okay
what there is a meadow up there so
okay no
i have something that you don't then
but so 'cause there's another vast meadow about an inch up from the attractive cliffs
so
we need to go in between the attractive cliffs and this meadow so like slope down to the
yeah
so
what you do go left at gentle slope 'til you're about a half an inch above the attractive cliffs and go straight to the left above them so a gentle slope down 'til the right of the attractive cliffs
yeah
just straight left for about an inch and a half
and then another gentle slope down to the left about an inch long
or inch and a half
yeah
ah okay oh are you
okay because alright s--
no
all i have is a chestnut tree
you have a spaceship
on the left of the chestnut tree
yeah yeah
yeah
okay
'cause that's where we're su-- is do you have a f-- an that's where we're supposed to finish
so
what you do if you're at the edge of the paper just drop down about
okay
mm
oke-- okay so another like very very slight slope to the left 'til you're about like a half uh a quarter of an inch away from the paper
and then you drop down about an inch and a half
then you go to the right about an inch
and a little bloop up
then you just go bloop and like about tiny tiny bit up and draw an "x" and we're done it should be right to the left of the chestnut tree
you're making me pick my nose
yeah just
sort of but very very j--
no
it's like it's so slight it's only like it's less than a quarter of an inch 'cause you just came to
just straight up
i guess it doesn't matter
mmhmm
so how f-- how
okay so
is the eh is the spaceship right to the left of the tree
oh no you should be y--
okay
well just just
go to the right about an inch and then draw an "x" and we'll be done
i got to see your map
okay
okay
