right
the start's just above the telephone kiosk
right
go down past the left side of the telephone kiosk
right down
for about ten centimetres
now
my map there's a stone circle
yeah
so
what you do is
if you
yeah
well
i've got a stone circle marked on mine
so you need to go underneath it so where you go is you go down the left-hand side
it's directly underneath the telephone kiosk
right so you it's
down about ten centimetres which should bring you right well i'll tell you p-- put it about twelve you're about two centimetres up from the bottom
of this of the paper
and go left for about five
centime-- no right for about five i mean
'cause that would take
towards the gate
but
then stop when you're
uh-huh that's what i mean
you're five five centimetres right
right just straight along
'til you're directly underneath the left-hand side of the gate
right
move straight up
and m-- go up past the left-hand side of the gate
'til you're abo-- right above it
are you there
right
have you got you've got overnight stop or something haven't you
right
well
t-- go up to there
it doesn't matter as long as you're just about at it
right
now go
have you got the ruined monastery
go up
to the top of that
'til you're right above it
you know above the centre
and go over and down the other side and go down diagonally about three centimetres
right
got to watch
'cause there's a lake west lake i don't think
i know
'cause i did this one earlier
right so
what you do is you go up sort of take up diagonally left on a very very slight angle eh for about five centimetres until you're underneath the stile
have you got a stile
isn't that over the other side
right
well you're going down there and you go along until you're underneath the left-hand side of the stile and then go up and over the top of it and stop there
are you there
right
go up about three centimetres direct straight up
and then along about two to the right
and you go down diagonal ano-- and underneath the bottom of dead tree which'll be the dutch elm probably
you there
well
avoid it then
underneath the dead tree
right now
go round to the top of the dead tree going up the the right-hand side
right
have you got a great viewpoint just underneath the east lake
hmm
right well
i've got two great viewpoints
yeah
well
i've got t-- i've got one there and i've got ano-- another one under the lake
i think maybe it might be a printing mistake
right what you you do is go about two centimetres up diagonally from where you are you should be right directly above the dead tree
right
go up about two centimetres diagonally
and then
'til and then straight up to the lake you should be just about under the "e" of the lake
under "e" it says east lake
right
at the bottom of the lake
right
follow the lake up to the left
right
and stop at the bo-- when it reache-- when it turns a corner ninety degrees stop right
the first corner
when you're going up the left
and then go for go about another two centimetres following the same route you were taking
just going past the bottom
until you should be underneath the the
you know see how the lake goes up diagonal it go--
it goes up diagonal after it turns ninety degrees it turns another corner
right and there's another corner there
you should be directly under that and that's the finish
