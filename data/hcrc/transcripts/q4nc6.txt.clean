er you've got the start right
you've you've got a camera shop
you've not got there's a park van parked van just below that
right
it's about three or four centimetres down from that
eh what you're going to do is go in between the camera shop and the left-hand side of the page
right
see how there's about a centimetre
you go from the start sort of do a curve to get back onto the line and go down due south for bddllpp eh
just missing the camera shop yeah
down to where's the allotments
yes there is
oh you go down about double the length of that
see between the start and the allotments
do the same distance again between that in fact a wee bit more i'd say about twelve thirteen centimetres down to the bottom
right
so you should be about a centimetre away from the left-hand side of the page and about two s-- two or three centimetres above the bottom
right
about one centimetre from the left-hand side of the page
yeah
uh-huh uh-huh right
okay
you've just g-- really got a straight line down from the start missing the camera shop
okay eh now i've got a parked van here so i'm just trying to go round it you're sort of doing a "u" shape back round past where my parked van is so just go east for about four five centimetres
right
so you're going aiming towards the yacht club but you're going nowhere near as far as that
right
below it not as far along as that
are you at whereabouts what letter are you under in the allotments
all right
all right that's good that's good
because what you're doing is you're going up the side of the allotments
so you're doing you're continuing that "u" shape from where you were at the start you're sort of going back up heading north towards the side of the allotments
right
see the wee black house at the left-hand side of the allotments
yes straight up f-- from there right
right so you're at the s-- you're at the
at the wee black house that's brilliant that's brilliant
so have you got a sort of "u"-shaped a sort of half "u" shape
right that's okay that's fine
right this is where it gets difficult
eh
'cause you're aiming into the middle of nowhere there's about
i've got a yacht club right
at the bottom right-hand side
right
see if you forget about the line for a minute if you pick a point about sssh
see the edge of the left-hand yacht right
the bottom edge of it the corner
if you aim above that for about six centimetres right
a point up there
if you can draw a diagonal line from the wee black house in the allotments up to the top up to the where that point is about six centimetres
i've not no
have you got a flight museum in the middle somewhere
see what you're
right
one centimetre to the right o--
i think that's o-- pff
right well what you're doing is you're drawing a line it's not exactly eh east right it's sort of between two and three o'clock it's very very gradual incline up for about fourteen centimetres twelve
see what i'm
doing i'm going up on a
c-- aye
it's sort of between two and three o'clock
right
its at the bottom of your flight museum
so you should be eh you sh--
i've got it aye that's a way up at the uh-huh
are you directly underneath that are you as far
a wee bit aye
right that's fine that's fine
that's great actually that's exactly it
right
you've got a disused monastery
haven't you
see from where you are just now under the "t" away down a wee bit fifteen centimetres down
you're going up and you're just doing a wee hill over the monastery from the right of the monastery t-- over to the left
right
you're just doing a big bump right over it
do you see what i mean
go up just well y-- any way you want really
this d-- this sort of does a curve just over the top of the monastery going from right to left
okay
and you're going down to just to the bottom left-hand side to the mona-- the disused monastery
right uh-huh
you're just going just a wee bit below that
right
eh now you've got a have you got an alpine garden
you have right
all you're doing is you're sort of doing see that wee f-- f-- bump you've got over the monastery at the moment
you're sort of doing that in reverse and going up towards the alpine garden so you do the bump in reverse and end up just going straight north up the left-hand side of the alpine garden
do you see what i mean
so that if you turned the sheet on its side it'd be a big "s"
right
eh i've not no
have you got a west lake in the middle somewhere
oh you aye
draw round it
oh score it out somewhere
eh so you're
right
so you're going up so you go up to the alpine garden you're just going sort of straight north to the
yes that's right
that's exactly y-- have you got a picket fence at the top
you're sort of under the "n" or "c" or something of the picket fence but you're about f-- about ten centimetres down well
you're just at the top left of the alpine garden
right
have you got a youth hostel which is
no you've not
aye the parked the parked van's got nothing
aye
he doesn't he doesn't go anywhere
your yacht club should be nothing as well at the moment
that should be in the middle of nowhere
eh you've got the alpine garden at the top le-- eh you're at the top left of the alpine garden right
you're under "n" or "c" or something like that of picket fence
eh what you're doing now is you're going along to the right just above the top of the alpine garden whatever those if that's weeds or something eh you're going along for two to three centimetres
okay
uh-huh to the right uh-huh
the top just straight across right
and you should be above the "d" end above the "d" of garden but you're un-- on top of the you know
right
and then you're j-- going just due north for three c-- another three or four centimetres
right
okay
have i got ah no i haven't no
have you have you got a thatched
no you've not i'd had this out with neil a thatched mud hut
you've not got that no
eh you've got the park--
right
so you should be sort of halfway between your alpine garden and your parked van really if you know what i mean
right is that right round about there
eh
then you're going now where are you you've just gone north haven't you
right okay
eh now go right for about two centimetres
okay
just a straight line right for two centimetres
yeah
you should be under the let-- under the letter "v" i think round about "v"
right okay so you're about two to three centimetres below the parked van at the moment
just right right
you've got that point there now you've got your telephone box right
see the letter "t"
draw a line from where you are at the moment diagonally right down it's a southeast
it's a big massive diagonal line it's about fifteen centimetres long or something like that
right down to the letter "t" right down to the bottom
to the bottom of it sorry
just underneath the letter "t"
okay
right
and then all you
fra-- frame it and
oh you should have seen neil's we had to start all over again you know
eh
we're underneath the letter "t" at the moment
go along just sort of underline telephone box just a t-- a fraction underneath telephone underline it right to the letter "x"
right
and you just go to the edge of the letter "x"
right
you're on the right-hand side of it
then all you're doing is going up for about another three centimetres to just just above the top of the telephone box
about half a centimetre above the top of the telephone box
okay
now this is where you've not got a thatched mud hut
eh you've got an east lake haven't you
right uh-huh
eh well what you're wanting to do is you see the bottom of the east lake the the line that's going down sort of diagonally sort of
uh-huh
well you're wanting see the "k" of lake
you're wanting to end up just about half a centimetre away from the bottom of the lake itself but underneath the letter "k"
right
but don't draw a straight diagonal line
okay
because you want to from where you are just now you're above the telephone box that right
you're wanting to sort of go it's a sort of curve aiming to the left and then going straight north
do you know what i mean it's like th-- the left-hand side of a "u" or something like that right
you're at the bottom of
i've not got a level crossing no
eh so you're
mu-- thatched mud hut it's directly above the telephone box at the moment
so that's what you're trying to avoid if you can imagine a thatched mud hut sort of halfway between the telephone box and the bottom right-hand corner of the east lake
right you're sort of going left
and then north up to just below the "k" but on the don't go into the lake just stay outside it
right
do you sort of see where i'm going
so you should have a sort of a "u" shape there
oh forget it oh you can go-- you can walk across that
right
right okay
and then you're so you're just underneath the bottom
right that's right
that's right
just you know the bottom of the lake it's sort of going diagonally
follow that the bottom of the lake right up keep about half a centimetre away from it and follow it up to the left
right
to the bottom corner of the lake the pointy bit
see it
have you got a pointy bit
yes this is t-- aiming towards the parked van
so you're right under the bottom corner at the moment
and just continue that line for about another centimetre and that's the finish just in the exact same
that's be-- just below the wee bump that's it
exactly
and that's it
that's it very good
that was that was a lot easier than the one with neil i'll tell you that
