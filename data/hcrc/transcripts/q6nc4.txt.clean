right
so you've got a a start i presume
up at the the top on the sort of left-hand side
have you got
yeah
so you want to go just round the side of the diamond mine
so you're at the bottom of that
right now ehm
have you got a wagon wheel
you've got
right
well
the bottom the bottom left
well
you want to just go ehm along to
you got the stone you s-- you got a stone creek yes
you got stone slabs
oh right
i've i've not got any of that i've got
oh the swamp is that to the left of the diamond mine
sorry right i see
well
you want to go to the right of the diamond mine just keep going the same sort of direction you are
in a slight slight up gradient for about
ehm eh have you got the swan pond at the bottom
the s-- no the
ah you've to go to the right
no sorry right at the bottom of the map there's a swan pond
do you see that right at the very bottom
uh-huh
to to the right of that have you not got a swan pond no
well
just just go eh to your right from the bottom of the diamond mine
eh in a slight up gradient 'til you're just sort of past centre of the map
uh-huh ehm
better make sure you're f-- a f-- a reasonable bit to the right-hand side of the map actually
'cause there's a wh-- a wagon wheel here you've got to miss
right now y--
ehm
you've got have you got a rift valley in the top right hand corner
and is that the only obstacle you've got
right well
you want to go up straight up and then along over the top of the rift valley and then down through the middle of it
uh-huh
down through the middle of it yes
right
so you're you're at the middle of the rift valley
now
have you got rocks below that
uh-huh quite a bit below
it s-- now
you want to go down straight down to about halfway to the rocks and then just miss the rocks on the left-hand side
a sort of miss them by go a diagonal line straight down in a diagonal line
missing the rocks by a couple of centimetres
right eh you've
have you got a stone creek
no you've not
right
uh-huh
well
straight across from the rocks on the left i've got the stone creek
so what you want to do is you want to keep going down the same direction you're going
and 'til you're about the middle of the paper
and you stop so you're in sort of in a line with the writing of rocks
you need to go down yeah
right
now you want to go
i've got white water you've you've got something else apparently
you want to go up slightly and
what have what have you got to the left of where we are
you've got rapids
ah right i've got white water so it's the same
sort of thing presumably
you want to go up the same sort of gradient to the left as you've been going down
if you know what i mean
so you're above
you're above the rapids
and then
c-- and then
come down the side of them at the side of them
right
so
have you got anything in the sort of vicinity round about here any obstacles
well
you want to go ehm s-- straight down well curve out slightly from where you are and then curve back in eh straight down to
have you got the stone creek
ehm sort of well ten centimetres above the stone creek in a line with just above the stone slabs that sort of level
and and above the stone creek you want to go down there in a sort of curved slight curved circle the sort of shape of an eye
i would say
above above the stone creek directly above the middle of that about where the just above the level of the stone slabs
have you got the stone slabs yeah right
right
you there yeah
right
have you got an outlaws' hideout to your right
quite a b-- yeah that's right
you want to go eh up up to that so you're just underneath the outlaws' hideout
now right
you're direct underneath the ou-- outlaws' hideout
you want to curve out to your right slightly so you're about two or three centimetres well five centimetres off the edge of the page
and then just go straight down
have you got the noose
uh-huh
go go just go straight down from there so you're eh at the bottom of the noose on the right-hand side of it
just a straight line down
right now you want to curve down
have you got the swan pond
you've not got the swan pond
aye right the saloon bar right
well
basically from the noose you're wanting to get to underneath the saloon bar
what you've got to do is y-- ehm drop from the the noose in a sort of curve to your left
so that you're just about the level at the top of the saloon bar
right now
just go along a a couple of centimetres not too much
and and curve curve up and then back down so you're ah
you've not got the swan pond of course see i've got a swan pond there you need to go up over and round
so you want to be going up
up the way slightly and then back down
i'm
ehm y-- yes
you go underneath the saloon bar and finish to the to the left of it yeah so from from here you want to go up in a curve and then back down so you're at the same level you were originally avoiding the swan pond that i've got
right
from there you just want to go g-- eh curves you're underneath the saloon bar
and from underneath the saloon bar
ehm
well the finish is
ehm i was going to say where where the says finish but of course that's not particularly useful
ehm a couple of i'd say five centimetres above the saloon bar and just off a few centimetres off the side of the map on the left-hand side that's where the finish is
y-- right
you're bottom of the saloon bar
right
you just want to curve up eh along past the saloon bar
and
ehm
it's it's about eh it's just a few centimetres out from the left-hand side of the page a few centimetres up from the saloon bar it's
oh you're going towards the right sorry
right
you just want you want to be you're at the bottom of the saloon bar
and you want to just head up head up to your left basically in in a diagonal past the saloon bar
right
and you should be sort of just a few centimetres from the side of the left-hand side of the page
is that right
well
that's it
