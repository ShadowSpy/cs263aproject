okay
um
do you have a telephone kiosk
it's at the bottom left
right
if you move so that if you move left and down so that you're on the left of the telephone kiosk on the way down you're almost at the bottom of the page almost in the extreme left-hand corner
now
do you have a stone circle
you don't
um if you move right along the bottom of the page until you're about quarter the way along the page
yeah
well
v-- closeish to the bottom
yeah
now
you should be about quarter the way along the page
do you have a farmer's gate
you do
well
can you move upwards so that you're left of the farmer's gate
right um
now
do you have a ruined monastery
yeah uh-huh
um do you have any other obstacles between the gate and the monastery
okay
um
what you want to do is move from the farmer's gate to the le-- from the left of the farmer's gate right and up until you're left of the ruined monastery
uh-huh
yeah and up
up and right
and straight up to the l-- right of the ruined monastery
mm
right
now if you move over the top of the ruined monastery and left and stop at the end of the ruined monastery if you see what i mean the left-hand side
and then move downwards a few centimetres and left
er mm do you have a stile
mmhmm
well
what you want to do is move along until you are level with the left of the stile
and then move up to the top of the stile so that you're on the left-hand side of it
now
if you move right so that you are level with the right-hand edge of the stile now and above it
uh-huh
and then up
ah no
right
if you move up a few centimetres and stop and then move right a few centimetres and stop
okay
now do you have a dead tree about ha-- three quarters of the way up the page on the right-hand side
you do--
yeah well tha-- that's fine
now
if you can move so that from where you are at the moment diagonally until you're underneath the tree
that's right that's right yeah
so you have a diagonal line
just underneath the bottom of the tree
now
if you can move around the tree so that you end up at the top of it on the right-hand side
now
on this map there is a viewpoint a great viewpoint and an east lake
uh-huh
do you have a great viewpoint
no there's another one as well
on this one
uh-huh hmm
yeah
on this one the viewpoint is underneath that and almost on the mid line maybe slightly left
right
so
if you can move from the where you are at the moment upwards and left so that you are just below the bottom of the lake and about midway along the lake
mm
you can move diagonally i reckon you could move diagonally 'cause you're going to be midway along the lake
oh yeah i see what you mean
no
midway along from the left to the right not from like the top to the bottom if you see what i mean
okay
right
just take where you are at the moment
of the tree yeah right
um
the lake on this map has a viewpoint
which is halfway along the bottom of the lake
and you want to move from where you are at the moment 'til halfway along the bottom of the lake
diagonally yeah
no
on the right yeah uh-huh
so go round it
to the left
and end up halfway along the bottom of the lake
right now
if you follow the bottom of the lake along to the left
and continue doing that until the lake effectively stops
then it goes up
in a sort of a curve
and if you can follow if you can continue to move left basing it on the line that you you're at just now until the left completely fini-- until the lake completely finishes
because there's a bit above you
so
if you cn you can actually do that and stop then that's that's it finished
