okay
now you're starting ehm above the diamond mine
and er the desert is below to your left
right
now
go go south from the diamond mine until you are still above the desert
okay
now
if you tell me what's to your right at the what's to your right
canoes
and a fast running creek
um
and do you have a graveyard
do you have a carved wooden pole in this area
right okay
now
go go right from the diamond mine
okay
and um
now you've got to pass
there's actually a graveyard to the right of the diamond mine on my map
no
on the same level as the diamond mine
and so you're going to pa-- you're going to pass by the graveyard as well
and then you're going to go up and over the top of the f-- uh
what i've got is a fast flowing river
do you have you have your c--
fast running creek
where is that on a level with the diamond mine or is it slightly below
slightly above
right
well i've got a fast flowing river here
so
what you'd best to do is go along past the bottom go along okay sorry go along to your right and veer slightly upwards as you reach the creek
and then go over and round the creek to your right
and then ehm
do you have an apache camp
right
see when you're over the top of the fast or your creek or the river that i've got here when you're over the top of that and in line vertically in line with the apache camp
go south until just above the apache camp
right
when you reach the apache camp
ehm do you have a walled city
right
well you're going to go from above the apache camp to the walled city but you've got to avoid a carved wooden pole
which in my map is slightly above the level of the apache camp
right
right i've got one of them as well
so
but there's another one a carved wooden pole here which is halfway between the walled city and the apache camp
okay
but slightly above the level of the apache camp
okay
uh-huh
so you've got so you're going from above the apache camp underneath the carved wooden pole and over the top of the walled city
and then when you reach the far si-- yo-- your left-hand side of the walled city travel southwards until you come to the level of some flat rocks
and go bel--
do you have a stone creek
right so
what i want you to do is go between the flat rocks and the stone creek
but do you have anything between the walled city and the carved wooden pole
a ghost town
so you're going to
that's not on my map
you've got to avoid that i think
so go south down past the walled city underneath your ghost town and then slightly up sort of northeast direction between the flat rocks and the stone creek
i've not got anything betw-- between the carved wooden pole and the walled city
but the map shows a curve a "c"-shaped curve
right
and sort of and then slightly up underneath the flat rocks and above the stone creek
okay
then
go slightly to your right beyond the flat rocks until you are above the level of the buffalo
i don't have a saloon bar here
right
okay so avoid the saloon bar
and ehm then right then ehm
just straight down to the right of the buffalo
y--
so that so that you're on you're on the right of the buffalo
okay
and go underneath the buffalo
now
do you have a cattle ranch
ehm do you have a fort
so you're going to go from the buffalo to the fort but you've got to avoid the cattle ranch on the way and you'll have to go up and over the top of the cattle ranch
which on my map is halfway between the buffalo and the fort
okay
ehm
it's almost on level with the fort but it's slightly higher than the fort
so you need to be go up on a sort of hill
over the cattle ranch
underneath buffalo or over the cattle ranch
then underneath the fort
underneath the fort uh-huh
and come out at the left-hand side of the fort and finishing ehm not beside but on the same level as the the carved wooden pole the base of the carved woode-- wooden pole
okay that's you finished
