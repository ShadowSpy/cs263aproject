eh right
the route's starting at the chestnut tree
okay
and i want you to go towards the left-hand side of the page
and just before you get there if if that was going forwards then turn to your right and go up about an inch and a half and then turn to your right again
then branch off above the attractive cliffs not quite in a straight not in a quite in a ninety degree angle ehm
uh-huh
from the chestnut tree right as if you were going forward to the edge of the page
but not quite
then turn to your right
and go up about an inch and a half or two inches turn right again not quite at ninety degrees and then turn if that was forwards turn to your left up to above the attractive hills to n-- near the vast meadow
right
ehm you go forward from there and you branch off
you can see that ehm jutty-out bit in crane bay you've g-- you've got
you've got to go up ehm to your left again but keep quite close when you get to that top corner
keep qu-- uh-huh
uh-huh
right
you've c-- you've come from vast meadow
right
and there's an outcrop of land well you're not going quite on to that
right you're going up to the next corner above vast meadow
just sort of diagonally opposite the "c" of crane bay
right
you've got to turn to your left up the way
do you want me to run by that one again
right where've we got to vast meadow
right
turn to your left at vast meadow
and then when it comes to crane bay you're keeping quite close to the coast
no
you're not anywhere near that
well you should be
ehm
retrack to vast meadow and attractive cliffs you should be in between where it says vast meadow and the the picture of the attractive cliffs
mucked this up completely have i
ehm right and you're turning left up there
uh-huh towards the coast
it's not really towards the coast it's sort of what would it be northeastwards no it wouldn't be northeastwards if you were coming that way it would be northwestwards
ehm along above where it says crane bay you keep quite close to the coast and above the "e" of crane bay you're making a ninety degree turn to your left again
towards the reclaimed fields
and you've got to skirt round them ehm taking a right turn
go right round ehm until you get to just above them
towards the chapel
and then you've got to go
the chapel
you do have a chapel
oh
do you have seven beeches
right
head up towards seven beeches then
and from seven beeches
right
i'll start in the right place this time suppose that's one point in my favour that i said start at the chestnut tree
that's just a habit of mine to start at the bottom of a map and work my way up
sorry
okay
okay
yes
right this is lindsey and melanie number "n" "a" "q" three "c" two plus minus four "d" "u"
right if you'd like to start at the beginning
at the start which is above the haystack
right
ehm if you you're heading southwards
ehm more or less straight slight bend towards the hi-- the haystack
ehm come down to about level with the carpenter's house and then you want to head along towards the carpenter's house
ehm head up ehm what what sort of angle sort of northeastwards towards green bay and stick fairly well
green bay at the top
uh-huh
no green bay
ehm there should be an inshot at the top th-- that would look like water
no
anyway head up for about two and a half inches from the carpenter's house
right ehm
yes
and in a more or less straight line sloping slightly down the way head along for about another two inches then slope down towards seven beeches
ehm curve round slightly to your right
yes
yes
because you're going round the chapel you should be heading down towards the reclaimed fields where we got to the last time
ehm you want to go you want to circle the reclaimed fields right round to your right you want to go round the right of them as you look at it
and come along for oh about two inches again and then head down straight down southwards towards the bay
and stick fairly close to the coast for about an inch and a half
then slope down towards vast meadow in between vast meadow and attractive cliffs ehm an angle sort of
uh-uh
have i lost you
right have you circled them not quite circled them come round to the right of them
uh-huh
right round underneath wh-- to where it says reclaimed fields
right for about an inch and a half
right
and straight down towards the bay
and you keep fairly close to the coast for about an inch and a half of that then head
i sound as if i'm making an awful lot of mistakes here
ehm head down at a southwesterly angle towards vast meadow and the attractive cliffs
right
you should be in between them you head down in a straight line between vast meadow and attractive cliffs
uh-huh
until about the "a" of vast meadow
right
and again the same sort of southwesterly angle down to where it says attractive cliffs
right
and then a much more westerly angle for about an inch and then following the side of the map down and then curve round eastwards towards the finish
at the ch--
at the chestnut tree
well i hope that's better than the last one was
right
see if that one's any it's probably
