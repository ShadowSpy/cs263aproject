right
go vertically down until you're underneath eh diamond mine
then eh go right until you're between springbok --boks and highest viewpoint
right
right go right
ah right
right to your right where what is the next obstacle
overgrown what
ehm no
ah right overgrown gully
there's no such thing eh on my map
ehm the next one you've got to go to can you see springboks on yours
it's right next to it virtually
to its left
just slightly below it
right n--
go along to your right eh from where you last drew eh in a straight line horizontally
and then go up between the the two words springboks and highest viewpoint
and then ehm once you then go round the top eh go to your right eh horizontally go
wh-- wh-- where are you at the moment are you just at s-- springboks here
right okay
right go vertically up then between the the springboks and highest viewpoint
no no
you're meant to be going between eh springboks and highest po-- viewpoint
and once you get to above highest viewpoint eh you go horizontally
yes
above highest
right then go eh uh to your right horizontally
then eh come once you're once you've eh passed highest viewpoint eh and there's nothing below you a-- eh apart from safari truck
if you can see that there
right go vertically down to just above s-- eh safari truck
right now what you want to do is diagonally eh from eh right to left go eh in front of safari truck
ehm you go up safari no no i don't mean go underneath it
go like over it as it were
eh right so you're actually going from going diagonally eh from right to left above safari tr-- truck
right
to just ehm below the level of field station
aye the banana tree bu--
is there a field station there as well
yeah right
yeah
go towards field station right
until you're eh u-- just underneath the level of the words field station
these are identical maps i hope
right eh right
then you want to go horizontally eh from eh right to left eh above the banana tree above eh the actual banana tree itself
yes
like that
right just p-- until you're past banana tree
then come vertically down until you come to gold mine
you don't have a gold mine
you must have a gold mine somewhere yeah
is it is it below banana tree
no
rock fall
surely between rock fall and banana tree you've got a gold mine no
is it is it anywhere at all near
eh say that again to the
right
now that's slightly down isn't it
and eh rock fall is like eh it forms a triangle
right
ehm
well my gold mine is uh the eh the mid point of the banana tree and rock fall line
so you don't have that ehm right
well mine that must mean that this that you can bypass this obstacle
so ehm from where you are you're you're you're next to banana tree the word aren't you yeah is that where you are
you're certainly above it right
okay right come eh vertically down to just below the word banana tree
now ehm since this obstacle is missing eh we can either go down and follow the exact same path as they've gone or we can go across to the rope bridge and down there ehm
just wondering i suppose i ought to keep it the same as what they've got
so ehm come down 'til you're just below the level of the word rope bridge eh just a vertical line straight down just draw it straight down
yeah
well no no
no
just a vertical line straight down ehm to just below the level of rope bridge
right and then eh and it's about ehm it's near the midpoint of eh banana tree rock fall line
it's just slightly below that
ehm then you want to go eh right ehm from left to right want to draw horizontal line ehm to about the middle of the page if there's if there's no obstacle there
right
you're bes-- beside rope bridge
yes
i meant to go straight down yeah
right
right
so you've just drawn a a vertical line from banana tree down right
now you want to go eh from left to right ehm about to the middle of the page roughly
right
then you want to draw a a vertical line from there up the way eh to the same level as the rope bridge
not the rope bridge word but the actual rope bridge itself
it's more or less yes in the centre of the page
right
then
right n-- from there you want to eh go from left to right across the rope bridge and it's actually ehm if if you think of a d-- it was it's not on the rope bridge the word but the rope bridge itself you want the the the line to pass through the diagram
right
right
now do you have giraffes in eh below rope bridge roughly
right
ehm now you want to eh draw a vertical line down from the where you've just left the rope bridge but to the the right of the giraffes
no
right so there's crocodiles on yours
ehm there's no crocodiles on mine
whereabouts are they eh n-- as with respect to the rope bridge
right i see right
yeah i s-- i suppose if
as long as we don't draw over the he-- the crocodiles themselves it'll be okay
right okay
so as long as you avoid them eh if you can just extend your horizontal line out to the the just from the the side of the page
well no i'm i want you to cross the rope bridge right
oh right
so they're so they're actually barring that way
eh can you dr-- actually draw round them
well if you could draw round them then
yeah
just to the left eh t-- sorry to the right of the giraffes in between the the edge of the page and the giraffes
right
now
you want to go from there eh to your eh left just underneath the giraffes
now is there any obstacle there
disthouse u-- no i don't have that
it's another obstacle right
ehm if you can just go round eh above the eh disused warehouse
and then you want to go eh under the great lake and to the finish
yeah
well the finish is just between rock fall and great lake it's n-- it's not directly between them but it's on the same level as that
so that's it finished then
