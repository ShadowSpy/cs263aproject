right ehm
we're at the start
right
it's actually off the top of mine as well
y-- you got the diamond mine
right you just want to go along to the left of the diamond mine well just down from the start so you're underneath the diamond mine
yeah
so you're underneath and
then
uh-huh that's right yeah
now
you've you sh-- you've not got a wagon wheel no
what've you got between the diamond mine and the rift valley
up at the top right
you've got a cactus
and is that in a sort of
un--
underneath the rift valley
uh-huh
oh right
right
well you want to go on a slight a a s-- well a slight gradient upwards to to your right
eh so you're just past the centre of the map i would say
ehm you should be a wee bit past the centre of the map
now
you want to go ehm just s-- straight up and then round so you go over the top of the rift valley and then down through the centre of it
yeah you want to go down through the centre of the rift valley
right
now
have you got you've got rocks right uh eh underneath
you want you want to go straight down and then sort of uh ehm half way curve out slightly so you go past diagonally past the rocks to the left-hand side you're missing them by few centimetres
you're at the bottom of the rocks
right now
you you've not got a stone creek to the left of the rocks have you
a stone creek
ehm that's to the left and slightly underneath the rocks is it
right
well you want to go
uh-huh that's right
you want to go down slightly from from the rock level and then curve back up and go over the the rapids so you're on s-- sort of directly on top of them
right
now
you want to eh curve down to your at at the side of the at the rapids a few centimetres out from them
ehm sort of five centimetres
just so you're
you see the line ehm so you're basically in a line with the end of the very end of the swamp
you want to go out that far
and then
we're eh straight down slightly curved shape a sort of eye shape so you come you come down to
you got stone slabs
you want to be
right well
you want to go straight down i don't know miss your manned fort and s-- the level you want to get to in this sort of curve is it should be directly
a slight curve basically s-- basically straight down and then curve slightly so you're eh right underneath the white water and just slightly above the level of the stone slabs it should be in the sort of shape of an eye
you know the sideways shape of an eye you get at school
that sort of idea of a curve
right are you there
yeah
you should be above stone creek
uh-huh
right
now uh
have you got to your right underneath the rocks have you got an outlaws' hideout
yeah it's
the gold mine
oh right ehm
below the rocks right
tha-- uh-huh that's right that's right below the rocks
you want to go up eh in a fairly sort of well just a sort of logical gradient so you're underneath the outlaws' hideout just right underneath it
uh-huh
now
have you have you got a noose below the outlaws' hideout
right
right
well
you want to curve out slightly so you're to the right of the the gold mine and to the right of the noose and then just come straight down to the bottom eh right of the noose
s-- right
now
you want to keep curving down to well basically keep curving down 'til you're above
you've not got you've not got a swan pond no
you've not got a swan pond
right well
you want to keep curving down you're at the bottom right of the noose you want to curve down so you're just a-- ehm sort of a few centimetres five centimetres from maybe above the end
you know the writing at the bottom the "n" "a" "q" "c" "6" stuff
you want to be just above that and your level is about roughly the middle of the saloon bar has your level
right
now
a few centimetres to the left of that i've got the swan pond
ehm don't don't write anything yet by the way ehm
i'm talking about three centimetres
probably
i see so you've got to basically from where you are go along very slightly and then curve up over the swan pond and then back down to the same level that you're at so the curve you want to get is basically to the top of the saloon bar is the level curve up there and then curve down ehm about well see you're
right
the end of it is at directly down from the end of the stone slabs
y-- no n-- aye the level you were yeah that's right
and from there you want to curve eh so you're underneath the saloon bar
yeah
and then
right you're underneath the "o"
right well
basically this is the bit i messed up a bit last time
the finish is just keeping going to your left and curving up past the saloon bar and it's a few ce-- it's about three or f-- maybe four centimetres out five centimetres out from the left-hand side of your page and it's just above the roof of the saloon bar and that's the finish
