right ehm
you've got to take your line down from the start to just vertically to just to the left of burnt forest
mmhmm
no
it's a tiny bit
okay and while you're doing that go in to your right a bit but it doesn't really matter
okay ehm
have you got a ravine
right
take that same line still down vertically to the left of the ravine
well just draw round it
uh-huh
is the cottage in the way there no
well that's okay
right now take that take the line
is the cottage directly beside the ravine
is there a space between them yeah
right take the line and go to your right underneath the cottage
can you do that
yeah
but i want you to draw up through between the cottage and the ravine
no
up through go g--
go down vertically until you're and draw underneath the cottage and then come up
between the cottage and the ravine
you weren't meant to
okay right
you went down past burnt forest
well
you weren't meant to
okay right
you're meant to come down from the start
vertically right past burnt forest
keep drawing vertically
past the cottage
then go right underneath the cottage
go up through between the cottage and the ravine 'til you get t-- to stop just above the ravine
and do you have a remote village
well on my map to the right of burnt cottage there's a remote village
okay
uh-huh
and that's just situated above the ravine
okay
so i want you to imagine i want you to imagine that the remote village is there just to the right of the burnt forest right so it's kind of like in a triangle
so draw your line to the right horizontally above the ravine okay
then do you have a pine forest
a pine grove uh-huh
i want you to draw the line keep going to your right okay so you're sort of like drawing towards the top of the pine grove then stop and go from left to right in a diagonal underneath the pine grove
from from the top of the ravine to underneath the pine grove
uh-huh
okay and then
do you have anything underneath pine grove
mm is that just right beneath it
do you have concealed hideout
okay right i wa--
that's fine
right
i want you to go draw to your to your right under the pine grove avoiding the avalanche
uh-huh
can you go between the pine grove and the avalanche
to get past it yeah
well draw that way
not co-- not completely down
just get past the avalanche right
and then ehm eventually i want you to go round concealed hideout
okay
to
to the right of concealed hideout
uh-huh
and i want you to draw underneath concealed hideout stop just underneath concealed bit there
okay are you there
right
do you have a boat house to your left
oh do you not have another one to your right of the concealed hideout
draw to just before the boat house writing starts there right okay that's where i want you to be
uh-huh
yeah
i don't want you to go near the river at all
no i want you to go to the boat house on your right on your on your left
thought you did
well i've got one i've got one to the left of the concealed hideout
uh-huh
have you drawn down to there
good
right imagine you've got a boat house to the left of the concealed hideout
right
do you see where in can you see crane bay
do you see where there's where the coastline comes round it's um there's a sort of like jutting out bit there's like a point
just underneath concealed hideout
or just to the right of it
okay
i want you to
you see where it comes down like that
well i want you to follow follow the line of the coa-- the coast there
so draw from concealed hideout vertically downwards 'til you come to that jutting out bit of the coastline then until until on that incline draw you know follow the line of the coast but don't don't go on to crane bay until you come to the the next bit that comes up okay stop there
right do you have ehm coconut palm to your left
no
do you have pebbled shore
well i want you to draw
uh i've got pebbled shore and above that i've got coconut palm
right
so imagine you've got a tree there and i want you to draw between where that tree would be where the pebbled shore is so just keep drawing go make your line go down a bit right and just to come to above pebbled shore and just stop the end there
and then ehm i don't suppose you've got finished marked on your map no
right
have you got anything below pebbled shore
well
