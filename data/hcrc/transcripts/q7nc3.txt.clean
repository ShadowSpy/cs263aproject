okay
have you found can you go to the start c-- ehm position please
there's a black cross
right just below the start position there should be the site of a forest fire
have you got that
if you could start from the black cross and go slightly to the left and then straight down ehm past the s-- to the side of the left-hand side of the forest fire the site of forest fire and keep going sort of down very near to the edge of the page until you come to a picnic site
have you got a picnic site
mm have you got an adventure playground
right okay
could you keep don't don't go anywhere towards the p-- adventure playground just now
jus-- could you go down from maybe the bottom you're still on the very very left-hand side of the page could you go down from the the writing that says site of forest fire
down about four inches on the side of the page just continue your path
okay
right
and then can you stop about an inch from the bottom of the page
and turn turn to the right hand side and go along maybe for about two inches just horizontally
and then i'd like you to turn upwards to the direction of the adventure playground
okay put and then just sort of skim along the edge of the adventure playground
and you should see there's a sort of climbing frame
c-- come up to the top of the climbing frame and then turn right
right okay
now
have you got there's a 'til you're just sort of right tu-- if you turn right and continue along horizontally for about six inches
you should have above you a granite quarry
have you got this granite quarry
yeah so that's okay it's supposed to be
you're sort of you're horizon-- you're level with the adventure playground but you have to right wait a minute go along about six inches from the adventure playground and then directly up
towards towards the granite quarry
and sort of turn right wait a minute you just sort of the right-hand side of the granite quarry can you go right up above the granite quarry
and then back down again
i don't have you got any obstacles in your way
mmhmm mmhmm
but you haven't gone through them have you
okay
right so
if you continue going right up above the granite quarry
you should come to a train crossing
do you have the train crossing
oh
oh right
there's t-- actually two on mine so if you uh you should have a granite quarry and then a waterfall well that's what i've got on my map
yeah
but on this map there's a train crossing
so if you could come down you go up above the granite quarry and then back down again but not too far
otherwise you'll pass through the train crossing in my map
so if you keep going along just about half an inch below the waterfall and right up to the left han-- no
mmhmm
oh no
you should have gone to the left
sorry towards the waterfall sorry
about couple of about half a centimetre
yeah
sort of over the granite quarry in the direction of the waterfall
just if you keep about two centimetres below the w-- the writing that says waterfall
mmhmm
not too far though
and then if you go up to the "w" of the waterfall and then straight up just about couple of centime-- no a centimetre a-- away f-- to the left of wa-- the "w" of waterfall straight up to the top of the waterfall
and when you get to the top of the waterfall oh you should just go up above the waterfall about five centimetres two inches
and you should be n-- n-- you should be near to the train crossing in
and cornfields
but don't just stay where you are just now
now if you go to the
if you can look back quickly at the granite quarry you should see a fallen cairn
i want you to go wh-- from where you are to just below the fallen cairn t--
just go past underneath it though
and then once you-- once you're past it can you turn back up to the left past and go up up the way towards the limestone cliffs keeping on the left-hand side of the limestone cliffs
uh-huh
erm sort of veer veer a bit to the left
k--
uh-huh
and have you got limestone cliffs
no i don't have lion c--
okay
well sort of keep to the left of the lion country and keep going up the way for about from the fallen cairn oh no about five centimetres just keep going up past the lion country
and you should come to an east lake
just go along skim along the bottom of the east lake to the finish and that's you
oh no between the cornfields and the east lake
about just directly in the middle and that's you
okay
