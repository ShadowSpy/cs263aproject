right lynn you're at the start
uh-huh
uh-huh
and you've got a burnt forest beside you just below it
what my map says is it's actually a curved line but i don't know whether to give you a curved line or a straight line i'll give you a curved line right
have you got anything like to the r-- to the left of the burnt forest
well i haven't got the carpenter's cottage
is that directly beside the ravine
a wee bit up
have you got the remote village
beside the burnt forest
no well what i suggest you do lllll ehm is like right there's a there's a line about quarter of the way down and it's the bottom of it it's from the start right and the bottom of it is in parallel with the ravine
you know the word
ravine
have you got that
right
so it's like
uh-huh
and it's like a curve
no no you don't
it's just like a r-- a kind of slight curve
uh-huh and it's just to parallel with the ravine the word ravine
okay
sorry yeah
it's a
it's a curve to the right
uh-huh
no
i have got the burnt forest
and it's not through it it's like
uh-huh
no not to the ravine parallel with it
bu-- right the bottom of the curve is like parallel with the word start
do you know what i mean
it's just a curve
know what a curve is
uh-huh
well the bottom of it
right
just draw a straight line
okay just draw a straight line
that'll be easy uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
mmhmm
and you s-- finish your curve at where's the start you know parallel ehm just parallel no no no no f-- just down from start
okay an--
and it's like parallel to the ravine the bottom of it is like well not parallel but on the same line as the ravine
what
right
is it is it stopping just down from start in a straight line from start
uh-huh good good
curvy to the right
right
and then you go across and stop
aye
yeah
it should stop at v-- you know doing the just in a straight line from the ravine
right
in a straight line to like a straight line across like
no uh-huh yeah yeah
no not across to there
vertical right a vertical line this is quite good vertical line and stop just where the "r" is in forest down from forest
do you know what i mean
mmhmm
oh no no
a horizontal line
right a vertical a
horizontal line mmhmm
just down from where the "r" is
okay
mmhmm
right
and then and then
go up again ehm you know how you got the ravine just go up and past the ravine
have you got the remote village no
well go back don't pass the pi-- don't pass the ravine
pardon
no
don't pass the ravine okay
it's the "r" of the burnt forest i was talking about
uh-huh yeah
right okay
and go up
up now
no
up towards just right up to the top of the ravine past the birds
no
up right up to the top of the ravine
you're kidding
mmhmm
mmhmm
right
do you want to start again
right start okay
vertical line down to the r-- ravine
uh-huh vertically down
okay
but missing out anything that might be in between
okay
i think you can
right vertically down 'til you're like in a straight
okay
no
you go along to where it says "r" of the burnt forest
a horizontal line
okay
just in line with the "r" of the burnt forest
and then you go up a vertical line
uh-huh
yeah you'll have to miss that
uh-huh
above that yeah
and then a horizontal line
under the remote village
have you got that
well don't go very far just go a little bit above the seagulls in the ravine
okay
and then draw a horizontal line
uh-huh
well a wee bit further
okay
no i ha-- oh yeah i have yeah
right uh-huh across to there
uh-huh
it doesn't matter i'm just going to tell you to draw straight lines
okay
and like you go right go in a vertical line down just until you you're underneath the pine grove
okay
and then
ehm
oh i can't get you
have you got anything
i haven't got that
where's that
uh-huh
below it right
tell you what miss out
have you got i don't think you'll have the concealed hideout
have you oh you do
oh well right just draw a line right draw a line until
what you've got to do is
i would suppose that your avalanche is ehm miss-- right your avalanche is like outwith the line
do you know what i mean
so like the line is within well m-- in my map i think the line is within the avalanche
okay right
what you do is w-- wh-- in my picture i've got two och how could you say bumps right i would say the avalanche is missed out it's drawn to miss out the avalanche
but includes within this line it includes the concealed hideout
so could you draw something that would
uh-huh
missing out the avalanche
and goi-- and go round the concealed hideout concealed hideout
uh-huh
go round it and include it in the line
oh good right
you d-- have you done that yeah d-- drawn it underneath
oh right okay
well draw a a horizontal line over
have you got the boat house
over to the boat house
right
no
horizontal over to the boat house
you're above it
i haven't got that
you're above the boat house though
okay right
oh i've got two boat houses
ehm uh-huh
right well go back up again to the concealed hideout
and you're you've drawn a horizontal line
uh-huh
i've got two
well
uh-huh yeah
okay that's good
right
draw it over to the other
have you got another boat house
oh right
well i've got two
i've got one parallel to the concealed hideout well just about
well what you could do is draw a line underneath the concealed hideout until you get
right see the "b" of crane bay
well until you stop at the "b"
uh-huh
stop at the "b"
and then go right down horizontal i mean vertical go right down
you know how you've got that have you got the crane bay have you got the actual outline of it
well go right down
no no no no no
until you're nearly touching it you're maybe just like half a mil-- half a centimetre
away from it
okay
and f-- and follow it
you know how that wee curve
there's a wee curve
follow that wee curve
right
no
the other way sorry the other way to your left
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay
and ehm have you got a coconut palm
no
oh well what you'll have to do is ehm eh follow that again go over the bump
have you come to the bump
right
follow it again
just so far like ehm uh maybe about two centimetres
over the bump
right
and then ehm how could you say this
have you got the pebbled shore
ehm well come round right follow the line down 'til you're maybe about och say about a centimetre and a half above the pebbled shore
do you know what i mean
draw a curve
uh-huh
and then come up over the pebbled shore
uh-huh
okay
and then just 'til you're right
what
uh-huh
have you
well miss out them
mmhmm
uh-huh right

or in the same level
oh well that's it
uh-huh right
where are you where have you stopped
oh no
what the line stops at the flagship well not at the flagship about two centimetres away from it
ehm
where
uh-huh
uh-huh
where are you oh oh what l-- what side of the pebbled shore are you
what
you're at the right of it
you should be at the left of it
could you go round
to i don't have the washed stones
right so
uh-huh i want you to go round the left of the pebbled shore
