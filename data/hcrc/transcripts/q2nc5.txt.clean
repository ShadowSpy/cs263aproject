right martin eh
you have the missionary camp in the bottom right-hand corner is that right
right
eh if you take if you go about an inch exactly to the left of that and stop
eh now you're heading diagonally down and to the left about two inches eh 'til you're within about three quarters of an inch of the bottom of the page and at the bottom left-hand corner of the missionary camp
right
eh to the left have you got gorillas at the bottom left-hand corner or a-- any sort of
banana tree right
okay
erm if you head left about four inches 'til you're at the bottom left-hand side of that marker that should leave you within an inch of the left-hand side of the page and about three quarters of an inch up from the bottom of the page
eh curve round and up keeping a distance of about an inch from the left-hand side of the page
eh just a small curve and then a straight line
are you at the bottom are you at the bottom left-hand corner of the banana trees or slight-- or just at the left of the banana trees
right okay
eh head up erm straight up about four in-- no about three inches
have you got a rope bridge there
right
just keep going up 'til you're horizontally level with the rope bridge
eh are you about an inch away from the rope bridge at the minute
just just over an inch
well head directly right over the rope bridge
yeah
eh now once you're at the f-- far right-hand side of the rope bridge
head down about half an inch just directly down about half an inch
now on the right-hand side of your page slightly above the level where you're at just now have you got a waterfall
right you see the the vapour
at the water
right
head right from the point you're at just now and slightly upwards until you're about half an inch away from the vapour at the left-hand side of the vapour
right
erm where are your lost steps in relation to the waterfall
have you got lost steps there
ah right
there are obviously two sets of lost steps then eh 'cause i've got a set of lost steps up and to the left of the waterfall about two inches away diagonally so
right
aye that's eh slightly further left than that again
so there are there are lost steps between the fallen pillars and the waterfall on my drawing
so on my drawing we'll be heading straight up between the waterfall and the lost steps
on yours i imagine we'll just be going up in a straight line from where you are now about four inches until you're horizontally level with the fallen pillars
right erm now
you're going in a a curve that's heading left slightly up and left going down to the bottom right-hand side of the fallen pillars from where you are now
sorry bottom right-hand side of the fallen pillars curving round from where you are now down towards the bottom right of the fallen pillars
okay right now it's just travelling underneath the fallen pillar the w-- the words fallen pillars about two inches the length of the whole entire drawing from one dot to another dot
eh that's about one and a half inches left so you should be at the bottom left-hand side of the fallen pillars now
no just just a straight line
left underneath the fallen pillars
now are you bottom left of the fallen pillars now
right
erm right imagine you're facing erm the bottom left-hand corner of the page from where you are now
right okay
yeah tha-- my route kind of circles round nothing in particular so i i assume that's the flamingoes
erm i suppose you'll be curving round eh well head towards the bottom left-hand corner the of the page for about an inch
and then perform a "u"-turn as it were about and head eh
yeah
then what i assume to be the flamingoes underneath and 'til you're facing back upwards again
have you got ancient ruins in your drawing
ah right
eh is it bricks with three birds above it
right
head from the point you're on now
eh well where are you in relation to the left-hand side of the page just now
an inch and a half
well eh try taking
eh could you make the the curve of the kind of circle you've got there a bit nearer the left-hand side of the page
'til you're within about half an inch of it
now head from the point you are now diagonally upwards until you're within a centimetre of the s-- leftmost seagull
at the ancient ruins of the ruined city
right erm
right from that leftmost seagull erm or slightly to the left of it head straight up about three inches
i've got stones in my drawing about two inches from the top of the page a-- well about an inch and a half from the top of the page
just just
just straight up from the s-- the the ruined city until you're within w-- until you've reached a point that's one and a half inches from the top of the page
and stop there
now have you got the white mountain in your drawing
well see how the left-hand side of the mountain comes down
eh go about half a centimetre below that and draw a line from where you are now to that point there
no
you should be moving along a horizontal line sorry you should be moving along a horizontal line towards the word wh-- words white mountain but stop before the picture of the white mountain
yeah that's right yeah
right that's fine yeah that's perfect
yeah uh-huh
but don't go actually under the white mountain you know
right you
you should be at the bottom of bottom left-hand side of the mountain now
right if you head diagonally up and to the right to the peak of the white mountain over the drawing
'til you're within about a centimetre of the top of the page now
head back down again round the birds on the right-hand side
if you got them there
eh now
erm come down to 'til you're about a centimetre away and horizontally level with the words white mountain at the bottom right-hand side of the mountain there
eh have you got a soft furnishings store on your drawing
right
well on my drawing that's about an inch below the white mountain
eh and you want to curve round and back between the white mountain and the soft furnishing furnishing shore store
eh so if you draw a line just underneath the words white mountain eh heading towards the word white from where you are just now
curving round and heading back towards the word white but underneath it about a centimetre underneath it
now carry on horizontally
to the left about another inch
uh-huh
now you want have you gazelles
right
if you head straight down to the bottom left-hand side of the gazelles
and then f-- going underneath the gazelles
go about two and a half inches to the right
and that's the finish
that's it
