right
do you see the start point above the stony desert
ehm heading towards the left for about two centimetres 'til you reach s-- above a-- equal to the end of the stony desert
ehm then start sloping downwards to the left
towards the bottom so you should be about an inch from the top from the bottom of the page
ehm
do you see the site of the plane crash
no
oh
no no
right okay ehm
he-- keep heading towards the le-- in a straight line towards the l-- the left of the page 'til you're about ehm an inch and a half away from the the left the far left-hand side of the page
and then start sloping up
do you see the collapsed shelter
right ehm
if you start sloping upwards slightly towards the right 'til you're about parallel with the top of the collapsed shelter but still oh about an inch and a half from the left-hand side of the page
so that should be about three and a half inches
right
so then start heading towards the right of the page ehm over the top of the collapsed shelter about three inches
ehm so you should be just at about the end of the collapsed shelter
right so go down to just down the side of the the down the right-hand side of the collapsed shelter 'til you're equal with about the bottom of it
now
do you see the savannah
right ehm
it should be about if you s-- a slight slope upwards to the bottom of the savannah it should be about three inches
right
so if you just head up towards the bottom of the savannah
not underneath it though
ehm
right mm
do you see the slate mountain
no ehm never mind
ehm once you get to the side of the s-- head up the left-hand side of the savannah about four inches
ehm now about an inch and a half back to the left
ehm do you see the hot wells
hot springs yeah
ehm from from where you are at the moment to about the bottom of the hot springs in a sort of d-- if you slope towards the bottom in a d-- uh the middle halfway you know underneath the middle of them about like a forty-five degree line
right
and now go to the left about an inch just un-- so that you're going under the hot wells
then
another sort of diagonal slope downwards but ehm slightly steeper than forty-five degree line
forty-five degrees for about an inch
ehm
right
then ehm
do you see the white mountain
right
well you want to curve up towards it but making where from where you are now so that it looks like the bottom of a basin curving up to the side of the white mountains it's about six or seven inches maybe not as much as that
ehm the left
mm
so go up the left-hand side of the mountain as if you were climbing it
and then ehm
head upwards straight in a straight line to about two and a half inches
ehm well yeah i don't have that so
just keep going straight up
ehm uh do you see the lake
right
if you start heading towards the lake in a straight line about three in-- just about three inches 'til you get to the the edge of the lake
then you're going round the lake in a clockwise direction
but not right round it
do you see the roman baths
no eh never mind
ehm just come round the lake and then as if you were heading back to the left-hand side of the page but but just if you just stop where you're parallel to where you started going round the lake about an inch down from there
right
and then do you see the where the antelopes are
if you just head down about three or four inches straight down and go down the left-hand side of them
yeah
uh-huh
just keep going straight down
and then
so you should be just underneath the antelope
then just
go in a straight line towards the right about two inches and that's your finishing point
yeah
