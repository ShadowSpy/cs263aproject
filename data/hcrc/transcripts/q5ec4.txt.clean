right
you start at the top left
right
and eh have you got cliffs below that just below and to the right
right
so go down just sort of diagonally just towards them but pass them
pass them on your their left
uh-huh
right
and then have you got a forge underneath the cliffs
oh
have you got an old pine tree sort of down diagonally right from the cliffs
right
well sort of pretend there's a forge right below the cliffs right and instead of right so you go down round the bottom of the forge so like draw a sort of a pretend semicircle
well like you know a pretend loop
right start right so you're just below the cliffs
right
so you go out towards outside of the map
yeah and then round the bottom of the forge which isn't there
but it's on on the same level as the pine tree
right
and then you go up the inside of the pine tree
right not th-- no that the left of the pine tree so the that's outside of the map
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
and then so you get to the top of the pine tree
right
and then go vertically across to about two thirds across the page
horizontally sorry
uh-huh
have you got a pine forest
on right
well you slope down with the pine forest on your right
aha so don't go round the pine forest just like pass down by it
right
and then just where the word pine forest is
just stop at the "p"
right
and then sort of loop round a wee bit more don't don't draw your line in the same angle sort of make it a bit flatter and then draw another wee loop
what
no
i haven't got a stream
eh
i suppose just avoid the stream
but g-- sort of like as though
you're drawing a nose right say this is the face you're drawing and then you've got to sort of do a sort of round bit for the nose
beneath the pine forest
uh-huh
right
have you got a bakery underneath right a bit lower down
right so see when the nose comes out it comes back in to the face
right
that should be just above the bakery
is that okay
and then go and do another big nose round the bakery
uh-huh
and then come right back in
un-- underneath the bakery and maybe in past the bakery about two centimetres just before the canal
have you got a canal
all right
right
just come in two centimetres towards the middle
from the bakery
right and then are you sort of above the "e" in crane bay
right
well go down towards the coast
right
and then follow the crane bay round the coast
to the to the left it's towards the "c" of crane bay
right
and eh then it's sort of
have you got wheatfields
oh
you got a rocket warehouse
mm right okay
is that sort of above the lighthouse
right
well sort of sticking to the coast
you know wher-- go-- whe-- whe-- where the coast goes up and down vertical
right
sort of don't go vertically down it but start sloping down towards around the top of the rocket warehouse
uh-huh
and then slope the line right out to the side of the page
uh-huh
the outside of the page and then eh sort of draw a
are you about th-- in line with the rocket bit or have you done that
no but like s-- see where your line is at the side of the page is that at rocket like where the words rocket are written
right
so we just like take the line down vertically down the side of the page
for about two centimetres
and then curve it back in towards the old
light house don't have a cave
you going to hit it
okay
yes yeah
oh will that put you in the sea
okay then
just stop at the old lighthouse uh-huh
