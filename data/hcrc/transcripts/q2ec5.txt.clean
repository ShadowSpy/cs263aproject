right mm
have you got a missionary camp down the bottom
then that's where your start is
right
okay well
you need to go ehm travel left about an inch and then go down along the side of the missionary camp so you're going downwards just running along parallel to it
okay
down so that you're about an inch above the bottom of the map
okay
now
you have you got a some gorillas over on the left
alright that's probably
do you think that's probably the same
mm yeah
so you just need to run along the bottom of the map until you get to just below the gorillas or the banana tree
right okay
right
yeah
well
actually you need to then you need to bend up round the side of the gorillas so you're then going along so you're running parallel with the eh left-hand side of the map
okay
so you then go upwards about
and then have you got a rope bridge
right
you need to run up vertically until you become parallel with the rope bridge
ah right
yeah
if you head diagonally across to the beginning of the rope bridge
and then you you're walking across the rope bridge so your line will stop and then start coming out at the other side of the rope bridge
okay
down about an inch so you come you've come off the rope bridge and you drop down about an inch
oh yeah
i for-- yeah there's a river isn't there
well
if you just take it so that you're running alongside the river
yeah so you need to run alongside the river for about um three or four inches
and then
you have got a waterfall on the right-hand side
well then um
just 'til when you're about ehm level with the b-- with the bottom of the waterfall
then you go straight upwards alongside the waterfall
have you got some lost steps there
oh no th--
these these are in the middle
have you got some fallen pillars
okay
well
where are you at the moment
yeah
right you need to go upwards until you're level with the fallen pillars
okay
and then imagine that you had
you see the lost steps at the top
if you imagine that they were there just where you've stopped
so you need to loop over the top of them as if you were going over something
so you you're going u--
right
you're going left towards the fallen pillars
okay
if you go over the
uh-huh yeah
and then you need to head back down again to go underneath the fallen pillars
okay
yeah
right
then if you go down and underneath what
i w-- i haven't got anything but i think that's where your flamingoes are
right okay
so if you then go right underneath the flamingoes
and and then up right up towards th--
have you got ancient ruins
yeah okay
right yeah that's right
so you go right up to the ehm ruins
and then you
keeping on the edge
maybe a bit in towards a bit heading towards the ruins
and then have you got some stones at the left-hand s-- on the left-hand side right in the top left-hand corner
okay
ah right
well you you know where the ruins are
you've got where are you now
right okay
now you need to go straight up so that you're now about two inches from the top of the map and about
yes
and about three inches from the side
okay
so that no
about two inches from the top
okay
and then
that's it and then right have you got a white mountain
right
you need to just run vertically along and then to get as if you were climbing the mountain and going back down the other side so you go along to the white mountain
up
up th-- up the left yeah
up the side of the mountain and then down the other side
then
have you got a soft furnishings furnishings store
okay
well
you need to then
right
you're at the bottom of the mountain now
okay
yeah
you need to go underneath it but by about an inch underneath
okay
and then
now now you should be level with the beginning of the mountain so you should be level with the left-hand side of the mountain
y-- you're going back on yourself
right
oh okay
um well so you're now you should be underneath the mountain
okay
now you need to drop straight down towards the gazelles
that's right
and then go round the bottom of the gazelles
and head off to the right-hand side
so you go under the gazelles yeah
that's where we're finishing soon here finishing here
so you're underneath the gazelles
yeah
straight off to the right about three inches and then we stop
okay so you're going in the opposite direction to the ancient ruins
yeah
okay that's it
