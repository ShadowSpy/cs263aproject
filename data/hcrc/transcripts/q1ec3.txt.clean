okay
start off above the diamond mine
right
now
go south from the diamond mine until you are just above the desert
that's that's correct uh-huh
and go below the diamond mine
and below the graveyard below the graveyard but above the carved wooden pole
okay
so you don't have a graveyard
do you have a fast flowing river
ehm mm don't know yeah it could be could be

right
you d-- uh-huh below the diamond mine
and then go to your right
you've got neither a graveyard nor a fast flowing river
okay right you've got a fast flowing fast running creek
i don't have a fast running creek
so ehm ehm i'm kind of stuck
erm mark no just wait
i know you're thirsty but just wait 'til you get to the desert
erm
well okay then right
you've got a creek i've got a river
so they must be linked somehow
so do you want to just go along to your right
and then go up and over the top of where the creek is
and then down south again
down south again until just above the apache camp
and pass that by go to your sou-- southwest of the apache camp
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
take the southwest direction
now
do you have a walled city
and do you have a desert
well
pass from above the apache camp um and over the top of the walled city but between the desert and the walled city
uh-huh
so that's over the top of the walled city
okay
oh that's fair enough
right just just go between those two
right
and then
continue south
right
until
do you you you have no carved wooden pole at all
a totem pole sort of c-- thing
right
well okay
do you have any flat rocks
ch-- do you have a stone creek in that area
right
right okay
right okay right
what you do then is you go south from the walled city
and you follow a sort of curve ehm
how do you describe the last south
sort of from g-- go in a
sort of "c" shape to cover the bottom of a "c"
right
from when you pass down below the walled city
go in a "c"-shaped curve
right
and then go between the flat rocks and the stone creek
okay can you do that
you pass in a pass
oh you're at the walled city
you're just above it have you come down
uh-huh
right
right
between the walled city and what
right
oh well i don't have this on my map
so ehm
do you have flat rocks
in line with the ghost town
right then
pass pass below the ghost town
but above the carved wooden pole and above the stone creek
right
so you're just
yeah
well then just make sure yous you miss that uh-huh uh-huh
no
don't go don't go below the wooden pole
uh-huh
but don't go below the level of the stone creek
right
no
below the flat rocks
you got to p-- you've got to pass below the flat rocks
right
so you're taking a sort of north
right below the flat rocks
okay
you want to veer ver-- to your right curve round to your right and go in a south south direction
and do you have buffalo
no you're not going into a saloon bar mark
right
right
go south
pa-- past buffalo
and then just in a s-- sort of virtual straight line past the bar mark
okay
and and do you have a cattle ranch
okay erm
do you have a fort
right
well
go past the buffalo
above the right below the buffalo below the buffalo right
that's right turn to your left
below the buffalo
right
at about at the level of the top of the fort right in line with the top of the fort
no don't pass straight across right
just curve downwards in a a "u" slight "u" a very very very slight curve and then pass upwards in a like an upside-down "u" because you want to avoid the cattle ranch which lies between the fort and the buffalo
there's a cattle there's a cattle ranch
that's right
so
you've go up and over the cattle ranch
then down
uh-huh that's right
and
and
right
and then down underneath the fort sort of um to your left
mmhmm over the cattle ranch right
and then da-- travel south and then
before you reach the fort
before you reach the fort
go down south
and then do you have anything else between the fort and the cattle ranch
you don't
okay then
so just go south and then straight along underneath the fort
emerging at the left-hand side of the fort and you've to finish opposite the base more or less opposite the base of the carved wooden pole
but still to the left of the fort
right straight up north yeah
and finish erm beyond the fort
and be at this at
to the left of the fort and level with the base of the wooden pole but not actually beside the wooden pole
