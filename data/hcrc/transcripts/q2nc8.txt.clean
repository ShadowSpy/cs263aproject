okay we're going to start above th-- directly above the telephone kiosk
do you have that
okay
you're going to move around the left of the telephone kiosk the same distance as you are above it
you're about what half an inch above it
okay
downwards sort of skipping
yeah
down until you're about an inch from the bottom of the page you should be skipping the edge of the page by about half an inch
okay
now take it do you have a stone circle at the bottom
no you don't
okay
now are you like if you come in a wee bit so that you're about an inch away from both edges
okay
if you get to that point
now move along about an inch
to the right
directly horizontally across
okay
now curve up and out a wee bit and then straight up
so that you're
see where your farmer's gate is
okay
we're going to come up on the left-hand side of that you'll just skim it by about a centimetre
okay
up to the left-hand side of it yeah until you're at the top left-hand corner of the drawing
of the broken gate that's correct
okay
now
you're going to move right
you know where the meadow is in the bottom right-hand corner
okay
see the third seagull along
okay
now go upwards until you're level with the point you're at at the f-- the broken gate
no no
don't don't draw anything yet
just like say with your finger an imaginary point
above the seagull so that both like your pen
and your finger are level
okay
now if you raise your right this imaginary point up about three quarters of an inch say
okay
see the point you're at there
draw a diagonal line linking these two points
okay
now
do you have a ruined monastery
yeah
right up at the middle of the page
okay
now if you say put make a point that that's just off the top right-hand turret or whatever it is you know just the top right-hand edge of that
it's about a centimetre off it
okay
if you draw a kind of diagonal line curving yourself
eh just from that edge to where you were
no
but you can go through that
okay
now do you have the west lake down to your left
okay
right if you draw like a curved arch from the point you're at eh over the top of the the ruins
okay
back down to like say a point that's level only on the other side
okay
right
what you're going to do is you're going to continue your downward line for about another inch moving down towards let me see in a compass direction it would be southwest
right just continue down the way
moving both outwards and downwards
okay
now skim a line that's pointing diagonally up if you take a point about an inch and a half from the edge of the page
level from where you are
okay
then move that point up half an inch so you've got a kind of diagonal line again
okay this is the left-hand edge of the page yeah
okay
if you connect these two points
do you have a stile above you
okay
are you downwards and slightly to the left of the stile
an inch to the okay
you could come in a wee bit so that when you go up you uh you go up to the top left-hand corner of the stile but you're only say about a centimetre from the edge so that's your line
your point should be downwards you probably got the distance correct down the way but that'll be your route
yeah
top left-hand corner
now if you like sort of draw a line along the top of that as if we're skirting round the ex-- the edge of it
again now we're going to move straight up about an inch and a half
i've
uh-huh
do you have an obstacle there
okay
now we go up
right so you're at a point that's probably about two to three inches away from both the top edge and the left-hand side edge is that correct
no
right can you see that point well if you imagine a point
right the top left-hand corner
if you come down about three inches
okay
and you come in about three inches okay there's a point
oh wait a minute
no no
i've got a great viewpoint away up in the top left-hand corner
no
if you diagonally if you came in the same distance again
do you get it sh--
oh wait a minute what would that be hold on
one two three say four inches ac-- in fact chris
four inches away from the top edge four inches away from the the edge on the left-hand side
now on my map that should be that's like up from the stile
okay
now if you're at that point do you have a a dead tree it's an elm tree down to your
okay
now see there the letter "d"
that one oh i've got dead tree you've got elm tree
is it
dutch elm
is it written underneath the tree
okay
see the first letter of dutch say
okay about a centimetre below that
okay if you draw a line is that a can you ha-- have a diagonal line going from where you are right down to
yeah
do you go through anything
okay
see the popular viewpoint what happened to it did we go round it or what
oh never went anywhere near it
yeah okay went round that that's fine
okay you're going to curve half a circle around that tree
up the way
so that
see the third branch from the left
until you're say above that that's your half circle
okay you've done a "u" turn
now
if you draw like a kind
let's see
see where you have the east lake at the top
right if you draw a line if you go from the "e" in lake down the way
okay
on to the edge of the lake
and then say about half a centimetre from the edge of the lake if you connect those two points
now skirt the edge of the lake to the left move left along the edge of the lake
for about three inches
yeah to the corner
so you're just past go past that co-- don't go up or anything like that just go past the corner for about an inch
and finish there
you
okay
