right neil
start
have you got the start just above
have you got a camera shop below it no
you have
right a camera shop
right
head due south from that just down for about twelve centimetres
have you got a parked van at the bottom
go round
go round the left hand side of the camera shop in between the edge of the page and the camera shop
right
you don't have a parked van
well go down aim towards the bottom and s-- stay about two centimetres up from the bottom of the page
a yacht club
right
so you go down to just bel--
see where the the words yacht club are
just go sort of go down towards the bottom of the page and draw a line towards the yacht club for about three centimetres underneath where the if you drew a line right across the bottom of the page it wo-- the line would end up under yacht club
right do you see what i'm
no
don't g-- don't go along to the yacht club though
right
you go down the side of the camera shop right for about twelve centimetres and do a sort of a "u" shape for and the bottom of the "u" shape should be about three centimetres long
right do you know what i'm meaning
right
no do-- all right okay
we'll we'll forg--
we'll forget about the yacht club just now
yeah uh-huh uh-huh
down towards aye where the yacht club is right
but forget the yacht club 'cause you're nowhere near that you're at the other side of the page
eh so we're going down it's now you do
right uh-huh
there's a parked van
and you're sort of you're sort of
you've worked it out already
eh we're doing a "u" shape round the parked van but it's a sort of three cent-- see if you imagine a "u" right the stems of the "u" the vertical bits are sort of three centimetres between
yes
aye
right go right down to the bottom
turn right for three centimetres
okay
three or four centimetres
okay
now you're heading back up sort of two thir--
have you got allotments
right
you're going up to the sort of left-hand top left-hand side of the allotments
from the bottom
right
that should be a di-- a straight line up the way
okay
right okay
so you've got a sort of "u" shape so far except it only
right okay
you're up at the top f-- left-hand side of the allotments okay
now see your yacht club
eh go to the left-hand side of the yacht club and up about f-- six centimetres
right
no
i've not got a flight museum right
so you're you're going diagonally sort of north northeast it's not it's it's a sort of two o'clock almost three o'clock from the allotments over
you're at the top
the left-hand side top
right
so you're going over the top of the allotments right now
eh no no
you're up you're going up sort of two o'clock in between two o'clock and three o'clock
you're going up the way to the see if you draw a line up the left-hand side of the yacht club right the way up the page
right
you're only going about i would say about two centimetres up from the allotments if you know what i mean
do you see what i mean
but you're
up from the allotments but along about twelve centimetres
okay
right are we starting
right sta-- aye right see
you're at the top left-hand side of the allotments are you there
right okay
see if you drew a straight line just east for about twelve thirteen centimetres
okay
right
just go go up about a centimetre from the edge of that so you're sort of going diagonally up that way if you know what i mean from it's about twelve or thirteen centimetres
not directly east but up a wee bit gradually aiming up the way
okay
right
yes
but you're about thirteen fourteen centimetres up the page
you're not oh j--
oh no
see your see your line from the top left-hand side of the allotments
i've not got a west lake
no
i've got a disused monastery aye
right
in relation to that we're due south about ten fif-- ten twelve centimetres
have you got a disused
is y-- is your is your d--
is your disused monastery in the centre of the page
right hold on have you got a sar--
right start from again start the beginning
where's my yacht club
away over at the bottom
right at the bottom right-hand side
we've got the same map haven't we
it's my fault i know what
i know what you're meaning
right
can we go back to the allotments
are you at the top
you're at the you're just at the side of the allotments right
okay
right
see the allotments
just draw a line right over the top of that east right
right over towar-- to stay about six centimetres from the edge of the page right east just go straight east
forget about getting it up a wee bit
right
right
so that's where we are we're about i would say we're if you you could we're about six centimetres from the edge of the page from the right-hand edge of the page and about six or seven centimetres up from the bottom as well
right
correct
right
oh dear
draw draw a line from there
you've got a disused monastery right
you're going from where you are just now just straight up and round the top of the monastery like a wee hill over the top of the monastery right going from the right-hand side of the monastery over to the left-hand side
okay
now you're coming down and you're doing the exact same hump again except invert it and you're going up
have you got an alpine garden
you've not
right
you do have an alpine garden
well you're doing a sort of hump you're just going up the side of the alpine garden
right
up the left-hand side sorry
the left-hand side of the alpine garden
so you should have
you're
right uh-huh
you're going across to underneath the left-hand side of the alpine garden then you're going straight up
okay
just to the top of just to the top left-hand bit of the alpine garden
have you got a youth hostel
you've not
right
the youth hostel is about it's a couple of centimetres to the left eh to the right and a couple of centimetres above the alpine garden right so it's very c--
d--
above right
so it's sort of
now you're going eh i would say about you're at the left-hand side of the alpine garden go across about two centimetres right just east
right
you're you're at the top left of the alpine garden
or have you drawn another line
right
top left of the alpine garden
draw a line about two centimetres right but just directly across
okay
yea-- eh uh-huh
over to the
you see the wee two two wee bricks at the edge of the alpine garden
there's two wee
two i don't know what they are is it bricks or is it grass right whatever it is och well it's two centimetres along anyway yes
aye
just a wee bit to the right of middle
sort of two thirds of the way along
eh right
and then you're going up about thr-- four centimetres st-- directly north right about four centimetres
okay
so you should be from the you should be round about above the letter "e" or "n" of garden eh about six centimetres or something is that right
okay
eh a wee bit
no it's it's my fault
eh right so you're up there eh go right for about three centimetres
eh
underneath the pa-- uh-huh underneath the parked van
go th-- go right
you should be under the letter "d"
right under the letter "d"
right
have you got a telephone box
police
right okay
you're doing a massive diagonal sort of south east
right
right to the bottom right to the letter "t" from where you are
to the letter "t" of telephone box
right
and then you're just going right drawing a line right underneath as if you're underlining telephone box and back up the right-hand side up the way now i'll tell you about that in a minute
right so you're going up
have you got a thatched m-- thatched mud hut
you've not
there's a thatched mud hut about
you've got a mud hut
you've got a mud hut about six centimetres above the telephone box directly above it
right
eh so what you're doing is sort of drawing
if you c-- if you can imagine an "s" round the thatched mud hut and the telephone box right
if y-- if y-- f-- oh forget
you've not got the mud huts
right
i have not no i've not
right hold on where are you just now
you're at the bottom of "x" oh right are you up a bit
you've come up a wee bit
well i would go up from the "x" right you're going up about three centimetres
okay
to the top of the telephone box right
and then you're sort of going diagonally across about eh i would say exactly sort of t-- what's it north i don't know what's the one northwest
if you go exactly northwest for about three centimetres four centimetres four centimetres right
exactly northwest for four centimetres you should end up above the letter round about "t" or "e" of telephone box about s-- eight centimetres above it
is that right see where i am
"t" or "e"
then go
have you got the east lake up at the top
you have got the east lake
have you got a finish
you haven't got a fini--
right okay
eh where are you just now
you're at th-- oh you're beside my thatched mud hut
eh you're going up just go directly north to the side of the east lake under the letter "k" "e" you know "k" or "e" in east lake
just to the edge of the east lake right
an "f"
an "s"
uh-huh
yeah aye
you're not going the other you're aye
you're only doing
"k" or "e"
just directly north to "k" or "e"
and you're about half a centimetre away from the edge of the east lake the bottom edge of it
okay
and then i would say you're about three cen-- four centimetres
you're following the edge of the east lake right up for about a centimetre beyond the left-hand edge of it
see where it gets pointy
yes
you're going over to the over to the left over to the corner
and about a centimetre beyond the corner keeping the same contour as the lake same edge of it
right
and that's the finish that's it about a centimetre beyond the edge of that
sorry about the mess here in your diagram
eh the parked van was nothing to do with it
eh the picket fence no that was another red herring
eh the west i've not got a west lake
your yacht club should be absolutely
right that's okay that's good
i think we're roughly in the same area
