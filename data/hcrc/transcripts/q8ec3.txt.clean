'kay
right starting at the top left of the right
if you come down sort of south southeast
you got a burnt forest
now come down round the left of the burnt forest so that you're just about underneath the "b"
oh right
right
now come down to the other direction now and
have you got a ravine
right
if you see the bottom of the ravine then take a line across to the left-hand side of the page
right
have you if you think of the ravine right
right uh-uh
if you we're going to go down
no i haven't
erm if if you can see the start mark
no i don't
if see the bottom of the ravine right
you're we you're going to end up in a line with the bottom of the ravine
right
underneath the start point
right
under the start point but on the same line as the ravine bottom of the ravine
right
if you could sort of curve round
so that you're vertically underneath the start point
missing
is it is that where your carpenter's cottage is underneath the burnt forest
well if you go to the
to the left of that
right
now
along so that you're couple of centimetres left of the ravine along horizontally
uh-huh
and do you have the remote village
doesn't matter
yeah
okay
if you go up sort of slope if you slope up to the top left-hand corner of the ravine
right
and go up another centimetre maybe
and go along 'til you're at the top right of the ravine
yeah and along a few centimetres more
do you have a pine grove
right
if you if you just take a straight line from where you are down to the bottom left of the pine grove
and do you have something underneath that
to the right
underneath the pine grove
right
erm
right
if you go under the pine grove
but at south a southeasterly angle sort of thing
and
so that you're and you should finish underneath
och no

you've got a concealed hideout right
right
no i haven't
we're trying to get to the right of the concealed hideout
right
yeah so
well aye
if you sort of miss out the r-- go round the avalanche
which i presume and you should be at the right of the concealed hideout
right
now go underneath it so that you're just underneath the "c" you horizontally are down to the bottom of the concealed hideout and along so that you're just about under the "c"
of concealed sorry
okay
do you have a boat house
oh there's two boathouses ah
well i've got another boat house
if you maybe two centimetres more past the "c"
yeah
right
and do you have crane bay marked
and eh is is it curved
where about u-- up above the "b"
of bay
well follow that curve round until you get above the "r" vertically down from the boat house and curve round 'til you get to the "r"
right
do you have a coconut palm
a pebbled shore
right
if you follow the coast round right until you get to above the pebbled shore
then you're going
no not terribly close
and then you're going to the left of the pebbled shore
uh-huh
above and to the left
okay
do you have something underneath the pebbled shore
right
i don't have these
if you go southwest that's towards the bottom left-hand corner
right
within a centimetre of the edge of the page
do you have a flagship
right
the finish
wait a minute
wait a minute right
the finish point is on land
on the same line as the bottom of the flagship
right
it's about a centimetre inland
and but you have to curve round the washed stones or whatever you've got there
and
presumably "x" marks the spot
