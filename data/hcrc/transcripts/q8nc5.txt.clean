right okay
have you got the start up at the top left-hand corner
to the left of the burnt forest
right okay ehm right
you're going to start coming down but a-- but as you come down you're c-- you curve to the right
uh-huh
bel-- just just below the burnt forest without touching the burnt forest
right
you're what you're going to do is you're going to curve to the right and then back left okay so that when you come you're going to be about three to four inches below s-- directly below start
understand what i mean
so it's not going to it's n-- it's not going to be a straight line it's going to be a curve
no
no you just see how
uh-huh you just
uh-huh it's just a slight curve
uh-huh and then back to the left
okay so you're about eh three to four inches below start then
directly underneath
right okay
so you're going to in a straight line go go to the right
have you got the ravine
right
going to go straight along ehm say about along to the right leaving about an inch about an inch from the ravine
uh-huh
then you're going to eh slope up to the right eh oh uh-huh to the left of the ravine you're going to slope up go above the top of the ravine
mmhmm
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
do you have the remote village
right
well it doesn't doesn't matter
uh-huh
you can go about a centimetre above the rav-- the ravine
okay
and then
uh-huh uh-huh
and then you're going to go straight along to the right in a straight line
uh-huh
okay
bef-- so don't go as far as the pine grove
right
so you should be about ehm level with the top of the pine grove that that far up
but you're about you know you're not in near the you're not at the pine grove yet
so you're about an inch and a half from the pine grove
you're going to your line is going to slope down to the right but you're going to keep to the left-hand side of the pine grove
i'm not making this very easy am i right
see what i mean
so you go down until you're a-- ehm 'til you're at the bottom left-hand corner of the pine grove
mmhmm
no not touching
okay
right right
have you got the concealed hideout
oh right
okay ehm
directly above the concealed hideout
okay well
i haven't got that
but what you what you're going to do is you're going to right you've got we've got another curve on the line so this is probably why you're curving to avoid that avalanche so you curve first of all to the right
okay
moving down all the time
you're just you're just you're going down but also to the right you're g-- you're n--
uh-huh
right
what happens is you go you curve to the right and then back into the left and then you curve r-- to the right again acro-- along the top of this concealed hideout
no
no
no
you're going you're going to go to the right of the concealed hideout you're going to go along the top to the right
mmhmm
'til you've sort of curved to the right then to the left and then back out to the right again
uh-huh
right okay
ehm right
so you're u-- a-- where are you now then
okay
right ehm you--
have you got the boat house
right
what you're going to do is you're going to curve round the concealed hideout going round the right of it and then straight along until you get to the boat house the bottom left-hand corner of the boat house
no
bottom right-hand corner of the boat house
right
okay right
have you got the crane bay
right y--
you're going to go straight down perpen-- eh straight down to the crane bay
uh-huh
oh is it
oh you've got a different boat house i've got two boat houses
uh-huh
so we've made a mistake you shou--
right okay you
see my boat house is to the left of the concealed hideout
right okay sorry
that's the wrong one
you don't wanna go anywhere near that one
right
uh-huh
just just scrub that bit out then and go back up to the concealed hideout
right so
le-- so v-- we'll say we're at the bottom right-hand corner of the concealed hideout
mmhmm
right okay
right
you're going to go in a straight line along the left of the page
okay
to to the left of the page
not not right along i mean it in a l-- i mean in a left direction
mmhmm
u-- under that a-- uh-huh al--
right
don't go right do--
right
you can go a bit further about another inch
okay
now right
look down to the crane bay right
ehm s-- straight down from that have you got an actual wee bay there like curves
hmm
from where you are at the moment
right
so we'll go straight down then straight down and don't hit the bay but f-- but follow that curve in the bay so you're going to go straight down south
okay
have you done that then
right
right
have you got the coconut palm
hmm
have you got the pebbled shore
which is where is it on your map
oh you've got another boat house
uh-huh but y-- right have
oh god right
where are you now again
mmhmm
mmhmm
right
right that's perfect
right
so you're going to come down and follow that wee curve
right
to the left
straight down and then left
okay so
you're you're sort of on on the corner on the bit that juts out now above the "c" of crane
is that right
right now
right
what you're going to do now is moving down all the time but you're you're not going to follow the coastline as much you're going to m-- slightly move away from it
okay f--
eh but going down at the same time so down about an inch and a half
uh-huh
ehm uh-huh yes more
or less but don't go as far as that
okay
'cause you're going to go you're about an a centimetre above the pebbled shore and you're going to go along the top of the pebbled shore
moving eh left
okay
then so
you're about so once right where are you now
right okay
move you're going to move to the left but moving down at the same time
okay
until you unti-- for about two or three inches until you're about a centimetre from the left-hand side of the page
no
where are your s--
uh-huh
you should be about a couple of inches below it but not directly under it
uh-huh
a good bit to the left of it
uh-huh
okay
where's your stones
right
okay
well you're going to curve round them
right
have you got the flagship
and the bit and the bit of land that juts out well and the bit that's
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
so what you're going to is curve round your stones there and your the finish is just ehm about a centimetre from that black line that's marking the crane bay ac-- just acro-- directly across from the ship
right
