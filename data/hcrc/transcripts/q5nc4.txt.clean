okay
you're going to go down slightly to the right just slightly in sort of ehm in a curve shape an outward curve curve shape from the cliffs
okay
right
you're going to go down
right
but just slightly down and slightly to the right
so you're get going to get a curve shape
uh-huh a--
curve at the cliffs
right
have you got a forge
no
right
come to the left
no don't go underneath the cliffs
no no no
it's like a backward "s" shape you're forming
right
so
at at the bottom of the sort of backward "s"
have you got that far
right okay right
from the start you're going to go down slightly to the right and form a curve an outward curve
okay
and then
you're going to do the opposite of that you're going to go out
further to the left
come back an old pine an old pine
right ehm
is the old pine at the the bottom of the curve or sort of next to it
underneath the curve
really ehm
okay
well you're going to go round the old pine
right
but
go round the old pine
okay
above it
above it
straight above it right
go slightly
let me see
ehm going to go to the left go slightly to the left and you're going to curve down just a slightly go about f-- about ehm five centimetres
right
go five centimetres
are you near a pine forest
right
right
go sort of like slightly just parallel to the pine forest but about three centimetres out from it
no no no right
right
go to the point where you're
see the top of the pine forest
the top of it right
you're going to go to the left right you should be at the left of it right and paralle-- parallel to it
right
are you there
okay
ehm
right
ca-- you're going to slope down and it's going to be
oh let me see how i could explain that
at about five o--
say how like at five o'clock you'll have a small hand with the small hand sort of like darting down towards the five
right
go down that that way to the bottom of pine forest at a slant
right
right now
you're going to form another outward curve like half a circle
just do sort of like a small half circle to your sort of like ehm a quarter down the page
right are you ne-- a--
right
are y-- you near a bakery
right
go right round that bakery
round the bakery
ehm go out out out the way
towards the towards the th-- ehm the edge of the page
no
right
i have wheatfields right
should be nowhere near them
have you
have you got a canal
now right
you're round the bakery you're round the bakery aren't you
so
you can't go round the bakery
right
go round the bakery
right round it and just pass i-- pass it erm a small fraction
as well
right
you're going to go straight down this time for about four centimetres
right
you're going to form another slight curve ehm another circle but you're going to do it ehm ehm convex towards the page like outward an outward you're forming the outward ehm form of a circle here a minute
no mmhmm
right
go go ehm three centimetres to the left again no wait a minute where are we three centimetres to the right
right are you near wheatfields
no right
go back 'til you're sort of like middle of the page right
but down slightly but you're sort of still in the middle of the page
are you near crane bay
right
right
see the second peak of crane bay
that's where you should be
right
retrace all your steps and go go to there
right now
is is there wheatfields near
uh-huh
shi-- right sort of trace that sort of ehm bevelled shape in crane crane bay and you want to get to the second peak of crane bay
right
the one that's towards the right
okay
right
follow that curve of crane bay down for about three centimetres
are you near wheatfields
no
that's that's okay that's okay right
go go along for another three centimetres
uh-huh
right
you're supposed to be just above the rocket warehouse
right
uh-huh
just you should be just above rocket warehouse
right
right
head t-- down towards your right at a slant
right
and then
you should be near enough at the edge of the page
you're about an in--
right
you're at the left of the rocket ehm rocket warehouse
above
above
right
go straight down to a slant 'til you're near enough just a centimetre away from the edge of the page
okay
go down by another three centimetres
and then
tutu
ehm
trying to think
yeah
well
you're heading towards the old lighthouse that's where you should be now
that's it that's it
yep
