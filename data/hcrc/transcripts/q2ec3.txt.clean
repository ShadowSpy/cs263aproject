okay ehm right
you have the start
right
below the start do you have er like a missionary camp
okay
well if you take it from the start just run horizontally
eh to the left for about an inch
and then go down along the side of the missionary camp
'til you're about an inch above the bottom of the map
then you need to go straight along for about 'til about you're about an inch and a half away from the edge of the map
okay
i have gorillas that's probably the
yeah
so you're at where are you now you're at the bottom
okay
now you you need to go parallel to the side of the map
ehm about four inches
so you're just ab-- y-- you're now about two inches above the gorillas or the banana tree
ehm do you have a rope bridge
right
you need to cross the rope bidge-- bridge
i haven't got a i haven't got a river marked but i assume well i--
if no
if you go if you're up going up eh vertically
by the gor-- gorillas
then you need to-- you need to bend it round to the rope bridge
and you're going across the rope bridge so your your line should stop at the beginning of the rope bridge and come out again at the end
right
then you go down about an inch so you're coming down off the rope bridge
uh-huh
now you need to run horizontally along
ehm do you have a waterfall
you need to run horizontally along until you're just below the beginning of the waterfall
okay
now straight up
do you have lost steps
oh no
th-- th-- th-- th-- th-- these are in the middle
okay
we right
you're at the bottom of the waterfall now okay
ehm what's your next thing that's marked
no the-- the-- they're not
oh i've got another lot of lost steps up there that's what you must mean
no well
in that case you need to go vertically upwards running parallel with the edge of the map
erm for about i don't know
way up
i have fallen pillars
are they sort of in the middle of the map on the left
right
well you need to go up but running vertically until you're about level with the fallen pillars
now
i've got some lost steps
so you need to kind of curve round as if you had something in the way there you can't go straight across to the fallen pillars you've got to bend up a wee bit
you see
like a-- like as if you were going over something
bend it right over
and then head it sort of up and round so that you-- you're going up over the lost steps
and then down and under the fallen pillars
okay 'cause you can't go straight across on mine 'cause there's lost steps
right
so you're now underneath are you at the end of the fallen pillars now
okay
now
ehm for some reason it loops round here again i don't there's nothing there though
okay well that's why
so you need to loop it round your flamingoes
and up so you
to the ancient ruins
yeah
so you need to go loop it down and then all the way up to the ancient ruins
okay
you're at the ancient ruins
okay
now bend round the ancient ruins until you're just now running verti-- so you're just going up from the ancient ruins now
have you got some stones at the top
okay
right
if you head it up towards the rock fall
so you now you now should be about two two and a half inches from the top of the map
okay
then
so you're at you're at the stones now
okay now straight across have you got the white mountain
under the stones
so you go straight across towards the white mountain
and then climb the white mountain and go back down the other side
have you got some soft furnishings store
underneath uh
no
right underneath the white mountain
okay
well you've go-- so you're at the bottom of the white mountain now
right er
this is difficult um
no
you don't go anywhere near them
no
well
you're now going you're going back the way you came so you need to it-- as if you're going right underneath the white mountain so come down a bit and then go right underneath it
about to about three inches
and now straight drop down
do you have gazelles
right
straight drop down towards the gazelles
underneath the gazelles
about three inches to the right
just and that's the end
because you come underneath the gazelles and then you go
go go right
and you stop on on nothing there's there's no mark there
okay that's the end
