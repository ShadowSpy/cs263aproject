right eh from start position you move down past the camera shop to the bottom left corner
yes
you move down to l-- past the left-hand side of the camera shop
and have you got parked van marked there beneath the camera shop
no
you move
well approximately three inches below the camera shop you make an arc and then move up up and around the left-hand side of the allotments
stop just at the bot-- the top right corner of the allotments just above that little shed
then you move in an angle slo-- sloping slightly upwards to approximately a third of the way across the page from the right and stop
it's not marked on my map
slightly below approximately on level with the top of the camera shop
a straight line yes
yeah
approximately two thirds away t-- from the right-hand side of the page
no sorry
one third away from the right-hand side of the page
well pu--
have you got yacht club marked bottom right corner
well it's just slightly to the left of the yacht club on a level with the camera shop roof
you turn straight up the page and make a straight line which curves over and around top of the disused monastery
have you got that mark
above the monastery
to the left up the to the right and then curves over to the left
approximately three inches
three four inches
yeah
yes
curving around the top of the disused monastery
and stop on the level with the base of it then the curve reverses itself and goes approximately li-- like it was before and then goes vertically up the side of the gr-- the alpine garden
right from the disused monastery the left-hand side of disused monastery the curve makes a dip rather than a rise a trough
and stops level with the left-hand side of the alpine garden
no
a curve poin-- going down the way uh
yes
yeah
you stop on a level with the m-- disused monastery to slightly to the left of the alpine garden
then you go up vertically 'til just above the alpine garden
then you mak-- go right to the end of the alpine garden
then vertically again to the top of the youth hostel
then about three inches
youth hostel was t-- upwards and to the right of the alpine garden if you go up from four inches from where you stopped at the alpine garden vertically
after where
after youth hostel
you'd be going an inch to your right and then a diagonal line sloping at approximately eh what'd it be now hundred and thirty five degrees from vertical
the telephone box
no
you go to about t-- two inches below the parked van
you go
two inches right from that and then a straight line diagonally 'til underneath the telephone box
yes
not directly underneath it
you're going to draw a s-- you're going to have to draw a straight line adding on to that that passes underneath the telephone box
then there's a straight line going under the telephone box
and a vertical line going up the right-hand side of the telephone box
it stops about level with the top of the telephone box
then there's a sort of exponential curve that goes up to your right from that point and it starts to become vertical to the left of the telephone box on a l-- line left of the telephone box
it's going
not marked on my map
it's going to the right to the left of the thatched mud hut and
no
yes
it stops approximately th-- on a line through the middle of the east lake
it'll probably mean go through that then
avoid them
right ehm
ehm no
it's going to the right of the parked van underneath the lef-- the very left-hand point of the east lake
it's on a level with the picket fence
have you got that top left corner
the finish point is on a level with that underneath the most left point of the east lake
right
it curves
eh if the telephone box is there it curves up and then goes like that
from that's from seen from my point of view
from the right-hand side of the telephone box it goes to the left-hand point
that's the path marked there
that you at the finish point
the left-hand bot-- corner
you go just about an inch to your left
and that's the finish point
on a level with the picket fence
