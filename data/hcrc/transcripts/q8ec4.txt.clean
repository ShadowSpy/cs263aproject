erm
are you at the cross at the start
right so
go er about two inches to your ehm to your left at a sort of a-- angle
about
your left a sort of angle about forty-five degrees
to er
well it's two inches
i don't know actually er
er well ten centimetres then maybe say
to the horizontal
no
it's different it's a different map ehm
well
it's to my right so it must be to your left
oh right sorry
right
go to your right then ten centimetres to your right
well i
imagine there's like a ehm a line like horizontal
right
and then let's say f-- ph thirty degrees up the way
so it's at an angle
so it's like an angle like that
oh dear
uh-huh
right
down below that
down below that
to about halfway down the middle of the lake
the b-- see where the bottom of the the bottom line of the lake
right
uh-huh about a
right
about halfway under that
right
see the bottom line of the lake right
right
see the bottom line of the lake right
halfway along that
right
and then
then
straight down
about
er maybe five centimetres
it sort of curves round
and then then
it's like an "s" shape right but n-- not like a steep "s" shape like a sort of er sort of stretched out "s" shape
a wee bit ehm 'til you're about er halfway down the page when you get to the bottom curve that comes back out the way
and then you go to your left
for about er five centimetres
er but you shouldn't be down there
this is you're over on the right-hand side at the right-hand si-- half of your page
no
it's east lake at the start of mine
right
well i don't have i don't know about
are you over at the right-hand side how about halfway down the page at the moment
what do you want me to start again
oh do you know what i've been doing oh god
i've i've started from the finish that's why i wasnae even looking at that i just saw the cross er right
oops right
so we should be at the bottom left-hand corner of the map here right
i've went through the the other way round that's really stupid right eh
so the start's about
the start's about a third of the way up the page
right
right
well i've not got that
no wonder we're having problems there
right so er
just sort of go to your left
about a centimetre
and then go straight down
to about two centimetres from the bottom of the page
then go to your right about eh five centimetres
and then go
uh-huh
so you
well
if you go straight up the way you'll be hitting the allotments so
well s--
just go straight up the way so you're a bit left of the allotments
up about half a centimetre ef-- left
and then like curve round the top of the allotments
and then go in an angle about say thirty degrees from the
say the allotments are the horizontal right
go in an angle about thirty degrees up from that
right
above the right-hand side
roughly
and then say about ehm eh over to about two thirds of the way over the side of the page to the right
no
and then you go straight up say about er to about halfway up the page
mmhmm
so y-- right where you are at the moment's just like see where it says disused monastery right
you should just be about next to that where it says that
and then
over the top of it
round and then and then li-- when you're round the side of that a l-- a straight line to about er maybe ten centimetres out from the side the left-hand side of the page
uh-huh
so you
well
it goes to the left of that
so and then you're up to the top of the alpine garden
and then you go to your right about er five centimetres maybe
and then straight up
have you got a youth hostel
well
it's sort of directly above the alpine garden except a bit to the right so eh
well
where are you just now
right
go along a wee bit
until see the "d" of the alpine garden on the in between the "d" of the see where it says alpine garden
right
just look at that the d-- in between the "d" and "e" just put a straight line straight above that
right
about er maybe ffffphhhhh ten centimetres
and then g-- go to your right about five centimetres
and then erm
aye just above that line
but you shouldn't be that near it you should be
right so the point you're at go er southeast
about er until you get to about halfway down the middle of the page
and then go straight for five centimetres
or then
uh-huh so
skirt round the bottom
uh-huh
and then go straight up
just about the top of the
no no
just to the top of the telephone box
see where the top is
to level with that
and then er
directions on er maybe north northwest for about er
until you're about a third of the way
no no say that
right erm
where you are you go northwest for about until there's about a quarter left on the page
if you see what i mean
well
i don't know maybe go through that it's straight up after that
until you get to the bottom of the east lake and then you go to the
have you got a finish
and then go to your left that sh-- should be you finished
mmhmm
until you get like the bottom part of the east lake erm you should just be like about
three centimetres from that
four centimetres maybe i don't know
that should be it finished
