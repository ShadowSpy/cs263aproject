you got a start which is above a diamond mine
yeah
yeah
well if you draw a line from the start from the left-hand side of the cross
straight down to an inch below th-- the diamond mine
you don't have a wagon wheel do you
no
yeah
you've got a rift valley at the top
top right-hand side
draw a line along to your right
like uh like a horizontal line
no
draw it along to the cactus
and then
if you go if you go straight up along to your right and down through the the centre of the rift valley
like through the midpoint of the rift valley
so you're going down into the rift valley
yeah
then
you've got rocks
below your rift valley
and you don't have a stone creek though do you
you got something there
just like along from the rocks it's to the left of the rocks
right okay
i've got white water which'll be the same as the rapids
but above just above it and to the right i've got a stone creek
so you're wanting to go betwee-- down to from the rift valley down passing the left-hand side of the rocks and then going just above the white water
a stone creek
so you want to go under it
so you're just like going just above the white water
and then you should be on the left-hand side of the white water
so you want to come down straight down until you're about two inches
do you have an outlaws' hideout
manned fort
do you have a noose
uh-huh
you've got an outlaws' hideout above the noose
yeah
well
do you want to come straight down from the white water 'til you're about
uh-huh
no
come come straight down in a straight line
until just below until you're about
yeah just keep below
and then come along sort of sweeping up to right underneath the outlaws' hideout so you're crossing the whole page
where's the fort
is it underneath the stone creek like directly underneath
so is it to your right of the stone creek and just up a bit
to your left and up a wee bit
yeah
mmhmm
no
and you've got stone slabs as well
okay
yeah
so it's like it should be a sort of diagonal line going up to get to it and you're at a lower point on the left-hand side
and the line's
okay
and your sort of line's gradually s-- sloping up
'til it gets quite close the ide-- outlaws' hideout
and then the line's going like straight down and past the noose
alright so if you've got something in the way there you'll have to go right round it
yeah
yeah
okay
i've got a swan's pond
which you won't have
erm it's about it's like on the same line as the saloon bar
but underneath the stone slabs
so you'll need to go round it kind of thing like up and round it
yeah
and then
yeah
and then you're going right round under the under the saloon bar up to the finish and that's us
have you not got a finish cross
no
the finish cross is directly
know how you can see the roof of the saloon bar
about an inch along is the centre point of that cross
so if you take line right up to about there
okay that's it
