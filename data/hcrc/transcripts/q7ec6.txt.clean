right
do you have crest falls
mmhmm
well on the the eastern side of the water bit you
see where the water is
no
at the top
right
see how there's a bit of rock at the sides at the top
the rocks
well o-- on the eastern side
right
r-- okay
take the middle of the falls
and go slightly to the east
and up about three quarters of an inch
that's your start point
you've got that
i should have worked that out shouldn't i
right
do you have mm banana something there
right
i don't
right
come along from the start point to just come straight west to the edge of the falls above the where the edge it would start to come down
just past the seagulls
now
come at a an angle of about a hundred and ninety-five degrees
come down to
ehm
right
you see the the middle line in the waterfalls
the waterfall line
at the bottom of that line
right
across from that i finished that line there
right
and now
curve round
ehm see where a-- to the bottom of the "c" of crest right you know where the "c" is
well maybe go two inches to the west of that
and put a point there
and draw a curve between these two points
ehm
a curved mainly to the the west so very shallow curve right not straight down then curve round just any point to join them it won't really matter
no
f-- the point from
uh-huh
what do you mean
down
down
uh-huh
to where i told you the wh-- to mar-- two wh-- inches to the
west of "c" to that point
uh-huh right
a positive gradient
now
go straight across from there to about two and a half inches from the edge of the paper
what's there
another banana tree
the extreme bottom
it's right down in the corner
right
just now you you'll be about an inch above the bottom
can you go straight across to about at that level from the bottom to about two inches from the the west
there's nothing on my map there
how far
right
to go up on the east side of the banana trees
how far out would you have to be
how is the banana tree area really big it's a s--
and it stretches from the below the footbridge
an inch in from where
and what do you mean an inch and a half across
that wide
that wide or that wide
thing is right you go along the bottom right and my route about just over an inch from the side of the page
goes up again until you're almost on a level with footbridge
uh-huh
that's what i told you to go over three inches
along the bottom
right
come along for three inches
no
now
you'll be about
well should make it just more than an inch from the maybe about two inches from the edge
right
right okay
you'll have to go round them then
now go up to where
go slightly curving
ehm until you're at the "f" not to the "f" but on a level with the "f"
and end up on the same sort of the same vertical
axis as
what tree trunk
i don't have the banana tree
right
make it that you're about three inches above the point you are just now three inches due north
and curve round your banana trees right if you've got to
an inch and a half say from there
right
now from that point you'll probably be just over two inches from the footbridge
draw a line from there to the the left-hand side of the footbridge
right
well almost due east you'll be just below the
think i'd on the picture right because you're going to go over the footbridge
okay
so
just go up to the edge of the footbridge
right
see the bridge bit along the top
uh-huh
where you can go over it
right
don't draw a line over the footbridge
there isn't one here
do you have a poisoned stream there
on the other side of the foot--
right
when you come off the footbridge go for about half a centimetre at the very most
uh-huh
half a centimetre out
uh-huh
and now
there isn't a slate mountain on this one
but it's below slate mountain
now draw a line due south
for about an inch and a half so y--
you're still above the start point
right eh
you have an old temple
now see where the "m" of
stream is
oh sorry right
okay
right
on this level
draw a line straight over 'til you're above the "s" of start
right
so you'll be about
right
and from there draw in a curve to the the base
see the base bit of the old temple
looks as if it's brick or something
draw a curve to there
uh-huh
there's no aban--
no no not that way
right
you've come across from the footbridge
okay
you're just at start now
now you know where the old temple is
well just draw a wee curve joining those two points
well as if
you'll see right say t-- imagine a clock face
between three o'clock and six o'clock
that would be the cur-- that quarter of the clock the way just picture that the way that would go
you're starting off flat and getting steeper
from six 'til three
uh-huh
right
now go s-- straight up straight north until about an i-- inch above the top of the temple
that'll be you near the mountain
right
now
don't draw a line but say
go in a s-- an inch and a half
how far are you fr-- how far are you from the "k" of abandoned truck
uh-huh
right
half take half that distance
and go up from there go up just over two inches
and that'll
not that high up
well
no maybe take it down another inch then
uh-huh
and about an inch above the top of the truck at the most
uh-huh there
no
well where you are ju-- put a put a wee point there
now from where you are just now on the line connect those two points
to the
right
you're just an inch above the old temple
go to that point two inches below the "v" of village
uh-huh
and now
say a s-- three quarters of a centimetre below the "k" of truck
now go down to there three quarters of a centimetre uh-huh
directly below the "k"
now go how far you'll be about three quarters of a centimetre below the word abandoned truck the words
go straight across 'til you're under the "a" by the same distance
now do you have baboons
right
from there go down two inches until you're about an inch from the line you drew to the footpath
go straight down
right
and now go across until you're about three quarters of an inch from the side of the page if you can do that
right
in fact to be safe make it half an inch to get round these baboons
now
have you got anything between this point and white mountain
right
from here
ehm
go up to go straight up to avoid the baboons
ehm
to about the where you started off to make that a "u" shape that bit of path
you know how you've come down and along
uh-huh
right
from the "a" of abandoned truck
you've went down
and then along
now go back up to about that level to make it a "u" shape
in that space there
it's maybe about a couple of inches wide
make sure you're ehm
make sure you're still at least two inches from the gap that down that "u" shape will be at least two inches at all points
right
so just go up to make that a "u"
and you're about half an inch from the side of the paper
uh-huh
well just go straight up until you're on the level of where you star-- at "a" below "a" three quarters of a centimetre below "a"
right
from there draw a line straight to the bottom left-hand starting point of white mountain maybe just to about half a centimetre to the w-- the left of it
uh-huh
where
where th-- about
at th-- not even that
about half that
right
and now
they'll if you g-- as you go up that side of white mountain there's a wee sort of ledge bit
you see that where it goes flat
you go up quite steep
on the mountain and then it flattens out a wee bit
no
below there about a third of the way up
there's a wee bit that's almost at a horizontal
no it'll be a different drawing maybe
right
you see about two thirds of the way up the mountain
its gradient changes to slightly less steep
uh-huh slightly
uh-huh
well
go up follow the side of the mountain up to that point still staying about half a centimetre away to a centimetre
and then have you got anything above that point above white mountain
do you have a pyramid
right
go
where is the top of the lemon grove uh in relation to the pyramid
right
now
go straight up just now until you're about on go due north until you're on a level with about the a third of the way up the pyramid
you see the black marks up the side of the pyramid
until you're level with the second one
uh-huh
and now would that take you above the lemon grove
now go straight across until you're about an inch from the second black mark of the pyramid
now
from there go to a point a centimetre above the peak of the pyramid
right
and then draw a straight line down the other side
um you see the the bottom right-h-- right-hand corner of the pyramid
the one that would be at the front of the pyramid
right the face not the one that would be at the back not the extreme right-hand point
about an inch out from there put a dot and join those two points and the
two centimetres
the poisoned stream in this one is a bit further below that see i've got two poisoned streams on this map
now
from there draw a slightly sloping curve again to below the "d" of pyramid
right just slope it round the natural way it would go
right
curve it round
to below the d--
right
where you are just now remember you do drew the test tube earlier
it would be like the bottom half of that test tube
uh-huh
to below the "d"
right
do you have a cobbled street
right
from there go carry on straight across until you're below the far left-hand base point of the pyramid
right
uh-huh
now at about a hundred and ninety-five degrees so that's just five degrees more than south
to the west side go down about well make it a hundred and
what did i say there
right that's fine
from there go down
do you have a remote village
you see the the two dark thick lines that are in that drawing of remote village
go down until straight down at that angle until you're about a centimetre to the side t-- to the west of the line
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
until you're about a centimetre to the w-- west of that
so just draw
uh-huh
now
from there draw another curve until you're below the "r" of r-- about a centimetre below the "r" of remote
right
and then go straight across to below the "e" of village
and then go about an inch further than that on the same level and that's your finishing point
uh-huh
just there
