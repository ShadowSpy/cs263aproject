start top of the extinct volcano
it's the bottom right-hand corner of the map
but it's marked well
have you found it
right and if you move maybe one and a half centimetres from the top of there to the left
and stop
horizontally yeah sorry
and then go down vertically about maybe five centimetres so you're actually below the extinct volcano you go down the left-hand side of it
and stop about you're there
then you go horizontally left
have you got a tribal settlement
that's in the bottom left-hand corner of the map
it's just a bit below the extinct volcano but sort just about the same level but the opposite side
so you go from that point where you stopped
along to the left-hand corner of the map to about one and a half centimetres from the edge
horizontal line straight across
well if you if you go if you're just below the extinct volcano just now a bit below it
you can go straight along and you'll be underneath the tribal settlement
one and a half centimetres
stop
have you got a rope bridge
if you go straight up the left-hand side of where the tribal settlement would be 'til you're ehm just maybe below the rope bridge but like in a straight line so you're not absolutely underneath it but you're to the left-hand side of it because it curves round over onto the rope bridge
you know what i mean
so
upwards for about
yeah
un--
no
'til you've f-- maybe one centimetre below it and then you sort of curve round
no
below
do you ha-- the left-hand side of the rope bridge
but you don't go a straight line and then turn you curve round onto the rope bridge
yes you cro--
are you crossing the rope bridge
well if you curve round slightly and cross the rope bridge
and then stop when you get to the other side
because you've got to curve down ehm it's not a wide cur-- curve it's quite a narrow curve down two centimetres
so
instead
no i don't
where's the machete
from the rope bridge
is that curving down a lot
'cause it's only about one and a half centimetres two centimetres you've got to curve down
you turn right and go straight across so you're th-- you're about three centimetres above the start position
and stop when you're you're
have you got a collapsed shelter
yeah
about two centimetr-- me-- --metres underneath it
have you got a saxon barn
well you go straight up from that point where you were
past the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter
just go straight up until you're on level with the top of the saxon barn
and stop there
no
straight line up to s-- the left-hand side of collapsed shelter so you're on the level with the top of saxon barn but not actually near it you're still on the right-hand side of the map
no
straight line upwards
why not
no you go straight up the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter
you're not going over towards the saxon barn yet you're going to be on the same level with it
no
no
so if you go straight up would you c-- curve round the crevasse to get to the saxon barn
if you go well i was going
but the the top of it
just a bit above
and you go straight up and curve round and then down and underneath the saxon barn
but not right over it
no right
ehm so you would
ehm is where's the crevasse from there is it underneath you
right
so if you go over the top of the crevasse and down the side of it then underneath the saxon barn
could you do that
yes
and stop ehm beside the "s"
saxon
and have you got pelicans
no
ehm go down about three to four centimetres from the saxon barn vertically downwards
just a bit above the rope bridge yeah
the end of it
and then go underneath where i've got pelicans towards the left-hand side
uh-huh
about a centimetre away from it
stop
have you got a white mountain
go straight up from there ehm slightly curving a bit round the white mountain
no
don't go over it g-- stop when you're parallel to the top of the white mountain
and have you got a golden beach at the top left-hand corner
go up to go straight up from the top of the white mountain to the edge of the golden beach
yes
so i've got secret valley
nowhere ne--
nowhere near secret valley
have you have you your golden beach is it at the top left-hand corner or the right-hand corner
oh well
there's one at the top left-hand corner of this map as well
so you're at the top of the white mountain just now
go straight up five or six centimetres and stop
well yes parallel to it uh-huh
straight up
stop
have you got slate mountain
go directly along from that point to the end of slate mountain
uh-huh left-hand end of slate slate mountain 'cause you go over the top of it
so just do that then go rou--
that's in the top left-hand corner yeah
kind of are you over the mountain
just go over it and stop at the other side and curve right round underneath it so that you're about a centimetre underneath the "s"
and you got a secret valley
can you go d-- v-- down from there down the left-hand side of the secret valley
and are you underneath the secret valley
go draw a straight line to the end of just about a centimetre away from the "y" and that's the finish
underneath the "y" of secret valley
mmhmm
that's it
