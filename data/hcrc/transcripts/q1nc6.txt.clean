okay
the start's at the top left
you have cliffs there
yeah
you don't have a forge do you
right
there's a forge about two inches beneath the cliffs
okay
yeah
yeah
it's about you know an inch or so two inches from to the left of the old pine
so if you just take a line straight down from the start
okay
four inches down four inches down just take a straight line
no
just draw a straight line down from the start four inches or so first of all
okay
you don't have a forge there but you know that's that's beneath the forge
okay
then go right to the bottom of the old pine
go up and round the old pine
you've got a bay at the top haven't you
i don't have a bay there but
if you just get to the so you know if you just go round the old pine
okay
once you get to the top
go two or three inches to the right 'til you get to the pine forest
okay
go down on the left-hand side of the pine forest
mmhmm
draw a line straight down
until you get to just about a centimetre or or two northwest of the bakery
okay
in other words the more or less the top left-hand side of the bakery but a an inch or so above
so then you go just go round the bakery in an oval shape
okay
right round it on the right-hand side
and you don't have a canal do you
the canal's about two inches to the left of the bakery
bu-- so go round the bakery
and stop about an inch to the left of the bakery
then draw a line straight down
to where crane bay starts to curve above abo-- above the gap but it's between crane and the word bay
okay
so draw a line straight down to there follow that curve to the left
until crane bay curves quite steeply away
but don't go don't go round there
okay
so then do you have wheatfields down there next to the bay
yeah
but you don't have to worry about those right now
okay then
i've got wheatfields in line
yeah
i've got wheatfields in line with the word bay about say an inch to the left-hand side of the bay
so if if where are you now top left-hand side of crane bay
just draw a line two inches down or in fact just draw a line down until an inch or so above the rocket warehouse
okay
go round the rocket warehouse in the same way as you went round the bakery but o-- o-- to the left-hand side obviously
you're towards the outside of the page
yeah
and so if you've gone round it don-- don't go beneath it though
okay
once you get to the bottom of it on the left-hand side of the rocket warehouse
okay
eh if you just draw a line more or less straight down to the left-hand side of the lighthouse because that's where the cross is for the finish
you've got a lighthouse haven't you
where's the cave
yeah
okay right okay
i i don't have a cave
t-- take the line from the rocket warehouse
right
don't go straight down take it right to the left-hand side of the page
almost right next to it
and only curve in where the bay starts starts again then trying you know
right
see the see the see the old lighthouse is
okay
yeah
draw draw
the line yeah
draw the line down to where where the land ends kind of thing
and then
so then then cu-- you know draw a line to the right-hand side sorry to the right
to where the the the cross is
you have a lighthouse don't you
the cross is just next to the lighthouse
the left-hand side sorry
okay
that's it
