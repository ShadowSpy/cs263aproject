you got an extinct volcano
right
you got a cross above it
start
right
you have got a tribal settlement down at the left-hand side of your page
right
what you're going to do is you're going to from the start you're going to go left and you're going to go down down you know like you're going to go across a bit and down to the bottom of the extinct volcano
know what i mean
no
uh-huh
right you're just heading down to the left diagonally down to the bottom of the extinct volcano 'til you're about a centimetre left of the "e" in extinct volcano
okay
see your "e"
right
go along about a centimetre and draw a dot
uh-huh to the left
no
b-- just d-- st-- across from the "e"
okay
just about a centimetre and a half
and draw from your start draw a line from your start down to that dot
uh-huh
diagonally down
well it's kind of down 'cause your start's above the extinct volcano
okay
so you've drawn a line down to th-- there
to that dot that i've just given you about a centimetre from the extinct volcano
okay
uh-huh
so you're going down that way and right keep on going down 'til you're about three centimetres from the bottom of the page
uh-huh
you're to go down like diagonally
no
you're just going down the side of the volcano until you're level with the the extinct
okay
right
diagonally go down towards the left about another two centimetres continue your line for about another two centimetres
down
okay
then st--
so you're getting towards the bottom of the page
right
now stop
right
now you you sh-- you should be about two or three centimetres from the bottom of the page
right
y-- on my map i've got a tribal settlement along to the left towards the left-hand side of the page
and what you're going to do is draw a straight line to the left
until you're about three centimetres from the left-hand side of the page
okay so just draw a straight line
centimetres from the left-hand side of the page to your left okay
then stop
right
see your rope bridge
you're now going to go up the page
towards your rope bridge and you're going to cross the rope bridge
okay so go s--
uh-huh just go straight up
and veer off to the right to the rope bridge
you know how you've the rope bridge
j-- just just go up as though you're going to
uh-huh
just you're just going up towards your rope bridge
and cross it
and cross it
okay
right
now you're at the right-hand side of your rope bridge
now can you go diagonally down right for about two centimetres just like diagonally down right not straight down
but just diagonally down right
for two centimetres
and stop
right
and then you're going to keep on going right but you're going to go straight for about six centimetres
have you got a collapsed shelter
right
just under the "o" of the collapsed shelter you're going straight right
until you're underneath the "o" of the collapsed shelter you're about th-- two centimetres below the "o" of the collapsed shelter actually
uh-huh
that's why you're going down
see i've taken you down diagonally right and then now you're going straight across right
see what i mean
right you've just crossed the rope bridge
and instead of going straight across to the collapsed shelter
i'm taking you down right and then across
okay i'm taking you down a wee bit down a wee "u" shape
aye it's a couple of inches across to the collapsed shelter
but you're only going down about a couple of er you're only going down about an inch
well don't go d--
just go down
okay
then you've gone along right
until you're about
uh-huh
but you're down a-- below the "o"
okay
okay
right
now i want you to go right through the "o" of the collapsed shelter
uh-huh
well you know what i mean you know as though you're going up that way
and i want you to go up there for about three inches
uh-huh
so i know exactly where you are
okay
go through the "o" of the collapsed shelter
and go up
have you got a saxon barn to your left hand side
right i want you to go up straight up the page
until you're ehm horizontally opposite the top of the saxon barn
okay
and now you now you're up here
now i want you to right you're going to v--
see at the "n" of the saxon barn
right if you want to draw a dot there
okay
that's where you're heading--
directly below it
that's where you want to head for
but you're going to d-- go d-- like diagonally to it
but i want you to go up a tiny wee bit first then go down diagonally to it
uh-huh
so it's like a wee hump
okay
uh-huh
you're going up and then you're going down just to underneath this point "n"
underneath the saxon barn
okay
that'll probably miss your crevasse
right you're underneath the "n" of the saxon barn now
right
just underline saxon barn to the le-- go t-- left until you're underneath the "s"
okay
right have you got a group of pelicans
right if you think see between this thi-- see how the saxon barn and the rope bridge are above each other
well to the left i've got a bunch of pelicans
so do you see what i'm going to
you've got the white mountain up above the saxon barn
well what we're going to do is we're going down and we're doing a "u" shape to miss these pelicans
so what you're doing is you're
are there they're horizontal to the saxon barn
but they're they're th-- they're they're they're down a bit they're in between the saxon barn and the rope bridge if you can think about it
see to like to make a triangle see the point of the triangle
if you make a triangle from saxon barn to rope bridge at the point and that's where the pelicans are
see if you join the rope bridge and the saxon barn together
and then like you make a triangle out of it
that's where the pelicans are
so you want to draw a "u" shape underneath these pelicans
so see from where you are at the saxon barn
if you go down diagonally left about about an inch and a half
okay
and then you go along for about an inch
and then we're going to go straight up to the white mountain
okay so you've made a kind of "u" shape
to miss these pelicans
right
go straight up 'til you're at the bottom of the white mountain
and right and see how the white mountain goes up diagonally right
pretend you're climbing the top of the white mountain
so you're climbing up to
oh you're climbing up to the top of the white mountain
okay
right up t-- up to the wee peak
aye
just follow the the route
as though you're at now you're at the peak of the white mountain
have you got a golden beach
well
right
go straight up as though you're heading for that big rock at the golden beach
see the l-- rock at the right of this big black thing
right okay
just a wee bit below that rock and stop
right
now we're going
completely rou-- we're going right now to the towards the slate mountain
okay
so go right until you're at the bottom of the slate mountain
it's just a straight line right
no
you're just you're just at the golden beach
and i'll
just at the left
ah right
but you you're y-- right okay you've got to the f-- top of the white mountain
right i wanted you to go straight up
ehm about three inches
just no i d-- i'll tell you what
see your slate mountain
you're going straight up until you're just parallel with the slate mountain
you know and bu-- sorry
see the bottom of the slate mountain
that's as far as i want you to go which is about three inches along to the left
okay
then i want you to go along
to the right three inches 'til you're at the bottom of your slate mountain
uh-huh
you know what i mean
it's about three inches
now you're at the bottom of your slate mountain
right climb your slate mountain
and come back down missing the seagulls
okay
so you're now at the bottom
right
and i want you to come back the way you came to the left underneath the slate mountain
okay
until you're at the bottom left-hand side again but this time you're down below it
okay
then have you got a secret valley
right
go straight down straight down until you're at and just like miss the secret valley go round as though you're ent--
right okay
go straight down until you're at the bottom of the secret valley
you've done that
and then go along right as though you're underlining the secret valley
and see just about a centimetre from the "y"
aron-- along to your right
that's the cross and that's the finish
uh-huh
that's it
uh-huh
and that's your finish
