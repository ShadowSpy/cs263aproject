you done this one before
oh super
you'll have no chapel
okay "a" "q" "7" "c" "8" plus minus "4" "u" david
right
you've got the start point
up high on the left-hand side yeah
eh you got a haystack
just below it
well
take a curve well
you know where the c-- er the carpenter's house is
well take about a couple of inches well about an inch a couple of inches just just below the start of it do a curve which just about meets the haystack and eh goes to just eh directly below a level with jus-- just below level with the start eh the carpenter's house
so you're doing it's like a
it's like
a backwards "c"
just beside the haystack meets the haystack just about about half a centimetre from the haystack and comes out to below the start line just below the level of the carpenter's house
right
you've got
directly below the start
yeah
then you've got about half a centimetre below the carpenter's house
you've got that point do you want to mark a point there
right
and you go from the start
so about you
start and you do a curve about half a centimetre from the haystack down to the point
yeah
just under the start
no
it's just under the start the point just under start and just under carpenter's house
so you're it's it's going just it's eventually going to end up just below the start line but it's half a centimetre under the carpenter's house
so
on the level
yeah
but across below the start
see what i mean
yeah
so it's that's the level you're going to
it's not
it's just to the le-- it's to the left of the haystack it's just a really shallow thing
right
you sti--
right
we'll start again then
you've got the start line right
and you've eh
well
you're going to end up directly below the start line
okay
down below start line
now
you want to
the point below the start line is level with about half a centimetre below the carpenter's house
yeah
so you've got about half a centimetre below the carpenter's house draw a line across to below the start line
right
well don't draw a line draw a point there sorry
okay
and you want to
you're going down towards the haystack
and you're missing the l-- haystack on the left by about half a centimetre
on the left of the haystack yeah
uh it's it's just a shallow
yeah
a shallow curve to that point down there
right
you want to go about an an inch to the right towards the carpenter's house
and then you want to go up
yeah
you want eh green bay
have you got green bay no right at the top
no
well you want to go up
yeah you're d-- well let me see i'll tell you in a minute
see the carpenter's house
you've got the left-hand side of the roof
well you've got about an inch from the top of that just less than an inch
and you mark a point there
right
and join up the two points
yeah
yeah
that's directly below the start
yeah
mm
no
right
from the beginning again
right
you're going directly below the start but you're taking a curve that just misses the haystack
it's just a really really sh-- shallow curve
right you've got that
you've got that in
you're going starting down
and then you curve round the other way and you come to the bottom jus--
well
right
from the start you're starting directly below the start point is where you want to go that well make that the first move
you got that you got that it's shallow curve
well not round
you want to finish below the starting point you go down you curve past you curve past the haystack
it's like a an inverted "c"
it's like a "c" the wrong way round
yeah
you're coming round to besi-- to below the start point which is also on a level below the carpenter's house that's to tell you where to stop
directly below start
aye
that's you
okay so you should just be about half a centimetre below the carpenter's house right
so you're half a centimetre below the carpenter's house you're on that level
so you come across an inch from that point
to the right
and that's about an inch from the carpenter's house as well
yeah
now
you've got that point in then yes
so you want to go up
you see the carpenter's house the roof the left-hand point of the roof
so you want to go up
there's an inch above there right just maybe a bit less than an inch
right
and you want to join that point those two points up and that's in a sort of thirty thirty degree angle or something like that
right
just take it across about one two two inches it's slightly below and eastern
right
slightly below it two inches slightly below east it's about like ninety five degrees
right
and you've got the seven beeches
see you're about an inch above the seven beeches and about an inch to the left of the seven beeches that right
not an inch above them
well you want to be about call it half an inch above the seven beeches
right
and from that point there you want to go about it's just off south to below the "s" in seven beeches
it's southeast you want to be going right just below the "s"
right
now eh
you've got reclaimed fields down below that
down below
well
in between the seven beeches and the reclaimed fields i've got a chapel
okay
so
eh what i need to do is i need to go round it again an inverted "c" well it's no an inverted "c" it's li-- the other way about opposite "c"
and you need to go around it so eh
yeah so you
the the actual point where you want to finish up is eh
you see the the thick tree trunk on the right-hand side of the seven beeches
so you want to finish
yeah
you want to finish about two inches below that
which is about h-- about a centimetre above the reclaimed fields
does that make sense to you
miles below it yeah
well eh
we'll call it just about two inches maybe a bit more call it two and a half inches below the tree trunk
right
and that's where you e-- want to finish up
so to do that you'll need to take from the "s" and go round like from twelve o'clock to three o'clock
and go out an inch
from the "s"
and then back into that point i told you
right
s-- now
you want to go like the end of a test tube like that way you want to go round the reclaimed fields like that
have you got crane bay
you see the m-- the most northerly tip above the "b"
well
you want to come round the test round the reclaimed fields and the test tube sh-- sort of shape to about oh i don't know about an inch and a half above the "b"
above the "b" yeah
well
no
above the point sorry
above the tip
no
yeah
so the shape will be you'll be going east and then you'll be going down
it's not
well prob--
it's just like that shape you want to do so you're going east and then you're going that curve and then you're going west until you're above that
tip
yeah
so you've got you've gone round the reclaimed fields
and you're about an inch and a half above the tip the northern-most tip
now
you want to go south down to that northern-most tip
right
just off to the left-hand side of it
okay
and you want to follow the contours of the bay round to the first
well you know how it it sort of goes down in a curve
and then you get a southern a dead south it goes almost due south
well you want to follow the contours round to that point
right
so now
have you got vast meadow and attractive cliff really close
right
well you want to go
see where it goes di-- due south
and then it almost goes due west
well you want to do a straight line about a centimetre you want yeah you've got that point come down the due south and come across the west
yeah
no eh
just a cen-- you want to do a centimetre above d-- the western-most tip right and draw a straight line from where you've stopped now
you know when y--
that's right
so it's about that sort of angle
now
you want to go due west until you're above the "a" in attractive cliffs
and then take it down about about the same angle as you took from the south to the west tip
take that down to the bottom just on the same level as attractive cliffs so you're doing down that angle and it's about an inch long shall we say
right you got that
now
in here you've got something to miss out haven't you
crashed spaceship
so you want to go west of the crashed space the crashed spaceship
you want over to its west
yeah down the edge of the paper
to just
to the level of a chestnut tree
when you get to chestnut tree curve round and go to about half an inch from the bottom of the chestnut tree
right
yeah
you go up about half the trunk of the chestnut tree to the dimple in the chestnut tree
you see the dimple in the chestnut tree
halfway up the trunk just before the
the branches start
you've got that's only about like a centimetre long
and that's your finish point
about half an inch
no
you're you're half an inch from the base of the tree
and you s-- then you go due north
from there you c-- half an inch from the base of the tree and then you go north half a way up the the tree trunk
all the way up the tree trunk basically to the stop at the
and that's your finish
so your the finish point should be level with where the branches start
that right
i think we got that wee bit in a bit sh-- stramash
