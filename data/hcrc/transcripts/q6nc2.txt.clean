right
start just above a telephone kiosk
does it
right
now you go down on the the left-hand side the telephone
down past the stone circle
the stone circle
yeah
and underneath right underneath the s-- telephone kiosk at the bottom there's a stone circle
eh say about five centimetres on the map
yeah
yeah
the broken gate ends the left-hand side of broken gate is the right-hand side the stone circle
whe-- whe--
eh the left-hand side of the telephone kiosk
no
it's it's eh it's about three centimetres down from the broken gate
which is called farmer's gate
underneath the stone circle
yeah
right
you're underneath it
right
you go up past the end of the stone circle
no
you go up past the stone circle
and around the top of the the farmer's gate the gate
yeah
yeah
just stop above the farmer's gate
yeah
you there
right now
do you have the meadow
right
well
you just ignore that completely
right
what do well basically you go up sort of a very slight diagonal line until you're above the meadow
yeah
right
have you got what have you got the lake
no
i don't have that
i don't have overnight accommodation
yeah well
that's that'll be that's probably where you should go then
if that's overnight accommodation probably want go there
it doesn't say go anywhere it just it turns turns northwards
a-- at that point
yeah
right
well it goes
it goes up for it goes up for about ten ten or twelve centimetres it skirt-- it goes round the north of the the ruined monastery
oh
where how f-- is it is your overnight accommodation directly above the meadow
right
yeah
just above the wee birds
right that's tha-- the-- right i know where you are
right that's it
right
that's that's where on my map is
uh-huh
oh have you got the ruined monastery
right
you should go up the right side and over over the top and down the left
but then stop once you're at the left side of it
right
yeah
just
yeah just about there
are you
right
we go w-- eh left right along
'cause there's a lake just underneath that there's west lake
have you got that
right
we-- west lake is between the start and where you are and it's sort of a big circle and it's the b-- eh the the top of it's just just very just underneath the ruined monastery writing
so it's just a sort of big circle
so if you draw that in
well
it's it's sort of
it's above the start whereas the th-- what is it it's a sort of eh
how can i describe the shape
it go so straight along the top straight straight down the right-hand side
right
just along a wee bit then a diagonal line up so it's like a triangle
fo-- you could join the bottom of the lake with the start and the and the left-hand side of it to make a triangle
yeah
but it doesn't go right the way along to the start it stops about halfway
right
eh no wait a minute
what have you drawn
a line along the top
right
yeah
it's not really straight but it's but it's easier to draw it straight
then
straight line down the right-hand side
eh it's going down towards the start
sort of s-- straight down
it goes about three centimetres towards uh it stops at the start you know
in line with it it goes about three centimetres towards it
right
and then goes up in a diagonal line for about five six centimetres
and then
it g-- and then it joins with the start i-- it joins with the top
right
avoid it
right
that's west lake
so
you're currently stopped in line with the ruined monastery wording
yeah
right
you go left along 'til you're in line with the left-hand side of the stile
then go up and over the top the stile and stop there
straight up
and ehm
as soon as you reach the top the stile turn right and go along 'til you reach the end it
right
uh-huh
then you stop
right
you go n-- go north for about three centimetres
and then go along for about one centimetre one or two i'd say two
i don't have that
it says great viewpoint
it's miles away from that wha--
there's w-- a great viewpoint
yeah
yeah you should be there
then you go along
eh no there's nothing on my map
right
so go about two centimetres along
to your right
then take a diagonal route down
have you got the dead tree marked
it says dead tree
eh
i don't have a l-- a rocket launch pad
yeah i've got the east lake
oh i don't have that
yeah
that's where i've got the lake
and there's a great viewpoint just underneath it
have you got that
oh i've got two v-- great viewpoints
right so i've got a great viewpoint just underneath the lake
but the-- there's a tree it's sort of black and wee branches it's g-- it's oh it's dead it's got no leaves on it
yeah
that's where mine is
uh-huh
you're above the stile to the right
did you you you went along to the stile and then you went up
right
you take a diagonal line down 'til you're underneath the tree
i don't know
right
you go around go round the right-hand side of the tree 'til you're at the top of it
go round the right-hand side the tree
and then go along along the the top 'til you're right above it
right
now
take a diagonal line up about two centimetres on quite a steep angle
to the left
right
then
go straight up to the bottom of the lake
yeah
right
well
you're about three three centimetres from the right-hand side of the lake
you're about three centimetres from the right hand side of the lake
towards the left-hand side
yeah
now
your lake see the wee bit of the lake know the bottom of the lake stops then it goes up a wee bit before it goes a diagonal
do you see that
right
go straight along the bottom of the lake following it 'til you reach there and then go about two centimetres further and that's the finish
mmhmm
follow the shape of the lake until you y-- until like you reach the
'til you reach the end of the bo--
know the bottom sort of slopes up and then there's a sharp there's er about a ninety degree angle and it goes north
right
you want to go along to about there and then go another two centimetres following the same line
yeah
right
go it's d-- eh go just about a couple of centimetres past that
just on the same a-- the same same way
no
the same way you were traveling
hmm
right
oh no
you're supposed to be at the bottom left-hand side of the lake
yeah
no
it was my mistake i didn't realise you were saying bottom right-hand
no
you want go same way you're traveling
just beyond the beyond the bottom of the lake for about two centimetres and that's the finish
it it should be directly under the left-hand side of the lake
