okey-dokey right so
your start's away up in the top
you got you got a wee cross
right
have you got the diamond mine
well
if you dis-- come down down the west side of that and hang a left right underneath it right underneath the "d" of the diamond
eh go along
you've not got the graveyard sure you've not
right
tell you what right there's a graveyard about an inch and a half to the east of the diamond mine
and you go along under the diamond mine and underneath the graveyard
no
yes
rightee-ho
so
if you go along 'til about a centimetre before you get to your ravine
then head north to the we-- past you pass the west side of the carved stones
yes
right
and have you got the indian country
so you come down the other side of the carved stones down and when you get to the top of the indian country just
you've not got the great rock eh
yeah just go down to the top of the indian country first
now
to the left sorry to the west of the indian country there's a great rock
right
well
on this one there's a great rock
so
if you go down a what does it say a f-- about a forty-five degree angle direct from directly above the big teepee
or wigwam
yeah
when you get to above the big teepee then it'll be go down about an inch inch and a half at a forty-five degree angle from that
then you go along over th-- over to the top of the gold mine
yeah they're yeah directly below uh-huh
yeah
so you
eh the west side
right
yeah
you're about forty-five degree bearing away from that
and you go down south until you're about two thirds of the way down towards the great rock
yeah
and then you go
have you got the trout farm
yeah
well
you go al--
right
you're you're at your totem pole on your map i think it is
yeah right well
if you go along underneath your totem pole for about an inch it may aye may be just over an inch
mmhmm
then head up towards the trout farm with your line coming down there g-- going up to the "t" the first "t"
then have you've not got the fort sure you haven't the cavalry
well
if you go along after the trout farm if you
right bel-- right underneath it
now
i'd say if you go along east about two inches
then
eh if you move it higher up give it a wee bit further than that
then
you've got the cattle stockade
yeah well
if you go straight down passing that on the east side just right until you come to the "e"
then
go westerly under it until you come to the "c" the f-- "c" in cattle
yeah
right
i'd presume that you've got something between the bandit territory and the cattle stockade
judging b--
yeah
well
if you do-- drive over the top of that just over the top of it and then come down the other side underneath the bandit territory
then
have you got the wee cross for your finish
no
well
about an inch to the left of the wee tree an inch and a half to the left of the wee tree that the bandit's lying up against
your wee f-- your finish sign's there
eh if you go under your bandit territory and up to it
you just go straight up to your wee cross
it's about prr an inch inch or so
there we go and that's us one map complete
