then go s-- up to almost the very top of the page
right
and then to your right again
well but
yeah
you're going to actually go through the rift valley
like the rift valley's like a half moon
you're going to go and you're going to come right through you're going to like intersect right almost at the midpoint of the rift valley
yeah
like right through the sort of midpoint like through the it's like a "u" and you're going right through the midpoint you want to be down into the "u" as though you were going if you know what i mean
yeah below
and then like into the rift valley
and right through
straight through yeah
and you want to go to the sort of midpoint of the rift valley you want to intersect in the midpoint of the rift valley going down the way
do you know what i mean
right
you've got in you're above the rift valley first of all right
yeah
above the rift valley
you go above the rift valley and then you start coming down as in into the rift valley and you intersect like the line of the rift valley in the midpoint
your rift valley is "u"-shaped yeah
yeah
yes
yeah
through the midpoint
below your rift valley about four inches down do you have rocks
and do you have a stone creek
uh-huh
yeah
i've got that
you've got nothing to like the left of it
well i've got a stone creek there
see in between
you want to go from the rift valley right down in between the rocks
no
no not sorry
i i i don't mean through the two rocks i mean like to the left of the two rocks about an inch
do you have white water
yeah that's true
and you don't have a stone creek above your white water
or a swamp to its left
to its left

you don't have like above the the rapids to its s-- slightly to its right you don't have a stone creek
no well
take your line right down to your rapids which is my white water and just like
above
right okay
right round the white water or right round the rapids
from the top
but stay quite close 'cause you don't otherwise you're going to be in that stone creek
right okay
come down come straight down to below that like j-- a straight line down but take it to at least two inches below your outlaws' hideout not like you mean like s-- straight down but like
in like length further down from that on the page
no
you got another stone creek
and stone slabs
no
well yeah
slightly to its right there's some stone slabs
no
how far down's the manned fort
take it further down go right under the manned go under your manned fort and between your stone creek
no
go r-- go down under your manned fort and then
go round the left-hand side
and then
when you get to the b-- when you get below it go up towards your ha-- outlaws' hideout and sort of take the line s-- sloping up so it's like going straight up towards the outlaws' hideout or it's going close to the hideout it's like you're so you're going to the other side of the page
yeah
right below your outlaws' hideout a good bit below do you have a noose
no
no i've got nothing
do you have a swan pond
no
do you have a saloon bar

you've got a gold mine a gold mine you got a gold mine below that
far below it
directly below it
aye
that'll be where my s-- that'll be where my stone labs
that'll be where my stone slabs are
i would imagine
aye right okay
so you're saying they're it's to the right then this thing
right above the noose
okay
well--
from where that line is that you've drawn go straight down 'til you pass the noose and you're passing the noose like on its right-hand side by a wee bit
if you know what i mean
yeah
mmhmm
yeah
then you don't have anything else down like
uh-huh
right
okay
right
you know how the like on line with the saloon bar
about two inches along i've got a swans pond
you want to avoid that

need to go go up above it
and then down and under the saloon bar to the finish
is that you
yee-ha
okay
