erm and walk above steadily or gradually heading upwards but only slightly up to above the meadow if you've got that
right yes
but come over the broken gate and then head over towards that
erm once you're above that head upwards to the right-hand side of the ruined monastery if you've got that
mmhmm
head up to the right-hand side of that but avoiding the the dead tree
if you'll erm come above that over towards the left-hand side
round down towards the top of the west lake
you don't have a west lake at all
