okay ehm right
take your line from the start and go vertically down past burnt forest
you have
okay it's underneath
right
i want you to c-- i want you to take your line vertically down past burnt forest and past the carpenter's cottage right
and just listen for a minute
and then the carpenter's cottage is to the left of a ravine
i want you to take the line underneath the carpenter's cottage and then go vertically upwards through carpenter's cottage and the ravine
yeah
okay do that
okay now you're at the top of the ravine ehm
is there a remote village above the ravine
okay
well if you could just imagine that's above the ravine on a horizontal line with burnt forest
okay
and go horizontally towards your right above the ravine
stop ah midway between the ravine and the pine grove
okay
right
now i want you to take that line go down towards pine grove just stop beside the writing pine grove
uh-huh
oh right and do you have any obstructions underneath the pine grove
okay
i want you to get to the concealed hideout
so ehm
is the avalanche to the right or the left of the pine grove
to the right okay
uh-huh
well keep to the left-hand side of the avalanche draw the line downwards towards th-- slightly towards the right okay i want you to go really close to the avalanche but don't go past it and then keep that line going vertically downwards until you get just above the top of the concealed hideout
i'm trying to avoid your avalanche but there's nothing here
if you can draw that straight line without
without
okay right that's fine
without getting in the avalanche that's fine
just above the the peak of the concealed hideout
okay that's fine right
now i want you to go round ehm to your left of the concealed hideout
is there a boat house
uh-huh but
i wa-- ehm i've got one to the left
okay
ehm so if you can imagine there's a boat house there so it's kind of like in the middle of the whole map
it's above that directly above that
okay if you can imagine that's there i want you to go i want you to draw it round concealed hideout come to the to the right of concealed hideout
okay
mmhmm
so take that line that have you drawn and
the right of concealed hideout
and then continue the line underneath concealed hideout so you're drawing to the right and then underneath concealed hideout
from right to left uh-huh
yeah
and then stop
do you see the bulge
it's like a it's an incline that goes down right the c-- the the coastline of crane bay comes up and it peaks at the top to the right of concealed to the left sorry of concealed hideout
okay you see that
and then it falls again there's a d-- a big dent in crane bay just above where it it actually says crane bay
okay
well i want you to draw the line from where you are just now and then if you could make it meet the coastline where that dent is
and i want you to follow it until it peaks again
well i want i-- you to actually follow it
to bay
yeah uh-huh
yeah
yeah
until you come to the next peak there
okay right
from now on you're going to go generally in a diagonal from right to left
okay
but i want you to draw above
have you got pebbled shore
well on my map above directly above pebbled shore there's coconut palm
okay
so i want you to draw from right to left in a in a diagonal passing the top of pebbled shore okay can you do that and just stop at the end of pebbled shore there
uh-huh
can you make it can you make that a diagonal sink downwards a bit
can make it curve dow-- curve downwards a bit
but s--
yeah
but still so that it's more following the the li-- the coastline again okay but coming away to go
it's a-- above pebbled shore
to the right of pebbled shore just above
ehm the same distance away as pebbled shore is away from the lower coastline
okay
what have you got below pebbled shore
okay
i don't have that
i want ehm you see where the flagship is
uh-huh okay
in a horizontal line from the flagships okay imagine a line drawn there that's the finishing line about a centimetre away from the coastline
okay
uh-huh
and i want you to draw from where you are just now in a semicircular shape until you come horizontal with a line
beside the flagship can you do that avoiding whatever you've got underneath the pebbled shore
that's towards the right
towards the left sorry
f-- it goes towards the edge of the paper
it is to the left of the flagship
uh-huh
about a centimetre away from the coastline
okay
