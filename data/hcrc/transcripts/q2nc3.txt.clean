right neil erm at the bottom
right-hand corner of your map do you have a missionary camp
about half an inch above it we've got an "x" marking start
have you got that
right
erm now i want you to take a route about one inch directly west
if the top of the page is north and the left-hand side of the page is west
i want you to go about one inch west
now eh
we're heading about two inches southwest
eh which should leave you t-- at the bottom left-hand corner of the missionary camp about an inch diagonally away from it
and then ab-- about an inch from the bottom of the page as well
now on your map on the left-hand bottom corner do you have a bunch of rather nasty looking gorillas
well i do and i think it's something we might want to avoid
right so erm
my route tells me to go on a slightly dipping downwards line west but don't draw it yet 'til i give you the exact instructions
this line is dipping slightly down and to the left keeping about well you'd be better to go to within about half an inch of the bottom of the page so at the bottom left-hand corner you should be about an inch from both the left-hand side and the bottom of the page a-- a half an inch from the a--
sorry i'll start that again
should be an inch from the left-hand side of the page and half an inch from the bottom side of the page at the bottom left-hand corner
okay
avoiding no
avoiding gorillas
have you got banana tree
yeah
right okay
so you're heading s-- s-- west but slightly southerly
right
stop about an inch from the left-hand side of the page
should be at a point about half an inch off the bottom of the page now
right
now i think we should eh read the banana tree as where the gorillas live so
erm avoiding the banana tree i suppose
erm go about
well hang on
have you got a rope bridge on your map
right okay
draw a line straight up horizontally level with the rope bridge
eh go across the rope bridge and just stop at the end of it
go directly down half an inch
go to
have you got a waterfall on your map at the right-hand side
right
go to the right and slightly upwards about half a centimetre upwards and about five centimetres to the right just beside the waterfall
so have you got a cloud at your waterfall
like a sort of steam you know vapour
right well you should be at a point horizontally level and to the left of that cloud
right head s-- s-- have you got anything between the waterfall and the lost steps
right
go up about four inches directly up so you're at the top right-hand side of the lost steps
yeah
alright
where are the lost steps in relation to the waterfall
seven inches
well mine aren't slightly nearer mine are only about three inches away
so if you go up four inches
right
from where you were directly
uh-huh
now draw an arc s-- a slight arc as if it was a lar-- a v-- very small part of a large circle from where you are to going slightly up and left and curving down to
have you got the fallen pillars
right
to the
where are they in relation to the lost steps
i mean where are they in relation to where you are now
horizontally level
right okay
draw an arc between where you are now to the bottom right-hand side of the fallen pillars
yeah up up to the left round the lost steps and curving down between the fallen pillars and where you are just now
eh at the bottom right-hand side of the fallen pillars
sorry
no forget your lost steps
i'm talking about my lost steps
sorry
erm
if y-- have you got that arc yet erm are you at the bottom right-hand side of the fallen pillars
right
erm right go about one and a half inches directly west
yeah
'til you're at th-- just beyond the f-- the far the bottom left-hand side of the fallen pillars
right we'll just take a quick check here are you about two inches from the far left-hand side of the page
well about two and a half
all right okay
and about nearly halfway up page
right
eh right go about s-- eh see from where you are just now
if that was eh mm how can i put this if that was the bottom of a circle right no sorry the right-hand side of a circle right
at the middle point at the mid point of the right-hand side of the circle
i want you to draw a circle erm
hang on don't draw it yet
i i'm still i'm still thinking what i'm going to say here
right so you're at the right-hand side of the circle
i want you to draw the circle it's about one and a half inches wide
eh 'til draw it downwards and to the left
okay
so you're really drawing a semicircle really eh
and that should leave you in a within about a centimetre of the far left-hand side of the page
no
right
right now have you got ancient ruins
on yours
ruined city
do you have sort of eh bricks and stuff and three three seagulls above it
yeah
right well draw a line from where you are just now a straight one up to the right beside the ancient ruins left-hand side of the ancient ruins
eh and now draw a small line about half an inch long to until you're directly to the left-hand side of the seagulls within about half a centimetre of them
yeah
just aba-- just a wee short diagonal one just a slight deviation
now have you got stones at the top left-hand point of your page
rock fall
mm that doesn't sound too chuffed
right okay anyway
i've got stones here
is the word rock fall under the rocks
sort of flat stones
jaggedy
oh right okay
erm well i suppose we've still got to follow this route
right go straight up about erm mm two inches say
from where you are just now
where are you in relation to the rock fall just now
horizontal from it
right okay
well on mine the stones are slightly above where we are just now
so um you go
so i think we're safe there
i think there's two different things but very close
right go east directly east about two inches and er
whoa wait a minute
have you got a white mountain there at the top right-hand corner
right okay
go t-- about two inches to the bottom of the white mountain
two inches below it
ehm where are you in relation to the top of the page just now
four inches
where are you from the left-hand side
right there're two bits right
can you keep on going up until you're within about an inch and a half of the top
right how close are you to the white mountain now
four inches right
just go east to the base of the white mountain then
eh now heading directly north east over the up to the peak of the white mountain
yeah north
are you
oh sorry
the bottom left
y-- scrub that out
and we should be at the bottom
left-hand corner of the white mountain
right
eh yeah
up to top northeast about two inches or so
one and a half maybe
right back down eh southeast
the same distance
now you're going into a curve
have you got a soft furnishings store
well that's directly below the white mountain about an inch so we've got about an inch to play with here
so i want you to curve round underneath the white mountain and then when when your curve is underneath the "n" of mountain
m-- make it into a straight line eh going left about two inches
yeah
until you're under the base of the white mountain
i mean the left-hand side where you were when you started going up it
right
right go about a c-- a further centimetre
left
now go straight down about three inches
and curve round to the right just just a small curve the the length of the curve should be about two centimetres
and
well have you got gazelles on yours
right okay
curve round the left-hand side of the gazelles
ah right
how far are they below the white mountain
right okay
well keep going
i think they're the same as mine
just keep going in a straight line don't go into the curve yet until you get to the gazelles
curve round the gazelles 'til you're facing right now
okay
right go about two inches
and that's us finished
yeah
