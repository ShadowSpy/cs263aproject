right ehm eh
the start is down at the bottom
i-- d-- do you just have a plain bit of paper
oh the right
see the have you got a stony desert down at the bottom right-hand corner
well
the start is just just above that
right
ehm right
we'll be working our way ehm up to the top and then back kind of down to the middle where the finish is
ehm from the start you go along past the stony desert and down
no ehm
yeah
right
and we're going left from that and kind of round round left past the stony desert and down until you're kind of level with the bottom of the stony desert
uh-huh
left from the start and y-- just just kind of round the outside of the desert you know right round the outline and then keep going down until you're kind of level with the stony desert
yeah
right
and you're down to the level of the bottom if you run your finger along the bottom of the stony desert
right
and then keep going straight along
uh-huh
you're going you're still going along left
ehm
about an inch an i-- 'bout an inch from the the s-- the left-hand side of the paper
just keep going along straight
and then we start going up
ehm
about three inches maybe
erm and there's a the site of a plane crash
oh right
erm does that mean that you have to draw this on
ehm
uh-huh
maybe you should just mark that on anyway
there's a the site of a plane crash just just to the right of your line
kind of near to the bottom
right
an-- and you carry on your line you've gone up about three inches and you start going right again
kind of a straight line about
er
no no
wait a mi-- wait a minute
ehm
yeah uh-huh
your plane crash should be kind of down a wee bit towards the the line at the bottom
yeah
about right
ther-- there should be about an inch in between the bottom of your page and your first line right
right
and then your plane crash is just kind of above that
uh-huh
'kay
yeah uh-huh
and you're going about another er two and a half inches maybe until you're kind of in the centre of the page i d-- i don't mean i don't mean right in the centre i mean
uh-huh
lower centre
yeah
and that
uh-huh
and then above that i mean sorry below that there's a collapsed shelter just below that line
elephants
i don't have elephants on mine
no not at all
ehm
and then you have to go down again
past the collapsed shelter
it's kind of underneath your line
and you go down again about half an inch kind of rou--
ehm it's kind of like a straight
a straight li--
not a str-- quite a straight line down but it's kind of it's vertical anyway
yeah
and then
yeah
uh-huh
and then you you're going you're you're still going right along
you're going right again uh-huh
ehm
about two inches
and you're kind of you're kind of going right and going up
the same time
oh
right
and you should be kind of ehm two and a half inches away from the right-hand side of the page just now
no
where are you
you should be kind of at the right-hand side
er
uh-huh
right
j-- just go further along then 'til you're
uh-huh
you shou-- you should be
ehm
how how do you mean
uh-huh
and you should be about two and a half inches fr-- from the right-hand side of the e-- edge of the page
yeah
uh-huh
kind of gently sloping upwards
and there's a savannah at the right-hand side of your line just now
well well
there is on mine
uh-huh
ehm
well y--
you go past
no not quite
we're still we're still a bit nearer the bottom
that that line shouldn't have been that long really
but this this line carries up to about the centre of the page but you're still kind of at the right-hand side kind of vertical line up
about ehm
yeah and
yeah
maybe about another two and a half inches
are you sh--
you should be about exactly halfway up the page
and but you're still kind of at the right-hand side
right that's fine
right okay
right
and then you go along left about an inch just a straight line
and underneath there's a a slate mountain
oh right
ehm after you've gone along your inch you know you start going downwards towards the left ehm
a kind of forty-five degree line about an inch and a half down kind of sloping
and you should be more to the left-hand side of the page now
kind of just off centre
right
right that's okay
and just after you've gone down your slope do another short line about an inch to your left just a straight line along
and there's some hot wells above this
no
oh right erm
now you should be about maybe two inches from the left-hand side
no
where are you
right
right
now we're going kind of down about another inch
uh-huh
oh
yeah
right
wh-- tell me where are where you are now
right
you seem to be kind of down a wee bit i think it doesn't matter
now
the line just goes straight up now kind of sloping towards the right
ehm
but it goes up quite far it goes up goes up to about ehm
ehm
wait a minute
the line that that i've just done which kind of goes from the right-hand side to the left-hand side is kind of sloping downwards right
right
and that kind of g-- that kind of takes you to th-- to the left-hand side of the page right
and the line now should be going right up kind of a vertical line
up quite high it'll go up to about the top third of the page sloping slightly at the end of your line to the right
sloping just at the end
at the right and you should be just about the top third of the page
no
oh is th-- is there a white mountain there
yeah you should be kind of
just at the left of that
uh-huh
oh right okay well
see the line should kind of slope towards the right
level to the top of the mountain
right
and then it should go straight up from there about an inch and a half just a straight line up
no none on mine
right
right
now you should be about maybe an inch and a half from the top of the page
yeah right
and then we go about two inches straight along to your right
mm no
and then ehm just just to the right of this on mine th-- there's a lake
is that there
well you you sh-- you
right and
you take your line right round the outside of the lake
so you're going up
round
down
yeah just uh-huh
until you're kind of maybe half an inch down from the the left-hand side of the lake
see what i mean
well y-- ehm wait a wee minute
you don't quite take it
know where yours says lake
you don't quite take it right round up kind of goes straight along
see what i mean
uh-huh right
right
okay and then underneath this line there's roman baths
do you have them
no
well
mine goes after you've taken your li-- rou-- line round it's kind of like a circle but it's it's not joined
it goes down maybe
well
it but it's not joined there's about an inch between the two lines
erm
see where your your horizontal line at at the top stops just before you go round the lake
see if you just go directly down from that erm there should be a vertical line about two and a half inches just at at the beginning of the lake
you loop down about an inch below that
carry on your line down about two and a half inches just straight down
yeah uh-huh wher-- where the lake starts but
right
put put your finger on where the lake starts
right
the wee bit that sticks up
a-- and go down about an inch
which is where your line should be kind of passing through
right
and then from there you kind of go down about two and a half inches
right
and do you have antelopes
it should be kind of erm the line should be going round the antelopes
to towar-- to your right your line should be at the left of the antelopes
right
and just carry on round the antelopes a-- and about an inch and a half just draw a line about an inch and a half to your right and that's your finish
uh-huh
