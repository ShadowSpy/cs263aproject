right
so the start is at the top left-hand side of the page
do you have cliffs just to to the right
mmhmm
do you have a forge below the cliffs about you know an inch or so down two inches maybe
you don't have a forge
well
the forge is eh below the c-- the cliffs say about two inches down
okay
so you go from the start slightly to your right down the way right a curve
to the bottom of the cliffs
and then you start to go left go about half an inch out to the left and d-- and down about you know two and a half inches three inches
an inch and a half
if you draw that line down you'll be on the left-hand side of the forge you don't have a forge but there is one there
so now you're about
you should really end up about four inches down from the the cross er you know in the same line like just beneath it in fact fo-- four inches down
okay
no no
no
the initial line from th-- the cross
goes right but it doesn't go as far right as the cliffs
it goes down to where it says cliffs
okay
about a centimetre from where it says cliffs to the left-hand side of it okay then you go back left slightly until you're beneath the the start and down you know two or three inches until you're ab--
yeah
until you're about you know four inches or four and a half inches or so down from the start
do you have an old pine
yeah
a single old pine
w-- and down down as far as that
okay
but you know beneath the start
so then you go right which would be under the forge and you go up over the old pine
okay
over the pine
yeah more or less
as as long as you avoid the forge and the pine you you don't have to
worry too much about the exact
route but eh
right
so y-- once you're at the top of the pine if you go about two and a half inches three inches to the right
have you got a pine forest
you have
well
just go down the left-hand side of the pine forest
you've got a bay there
i don't have a bay there
it'll be at the top
have you got a bay at the bottom
crane bay
where's the one at the top
how far down
yeah well
don't go much you know don't go any higher than than the the height of the old pine or or the forest that must be where the bay is i don't have a bay there but th-- the route you know must miss the bay er so you know just go along 'til you get to the pine forest more or less and then go go down on the left-hand side of the pine forest
okay
once you're at the bottom of the pine forest just where it says pine
okay
if you if you just kind of draw a draw an arc er to the right just more or less the same direction as you've been going until
have you got wheatfields
on your map
no well the
you have right
well
just draw the arc and stop the arc t-- you know in line with the wheatfields but beneath the pine forest
okay
oh two or three inches down from the pine forest
okay you know
it doesn't have to be an arc as long as you avoid all the obstacles i think eh if you you know if you finish up eh in line with the wheatfields
okay
but beneath the pine forest you if you stop drawing your line there
above the bakery in other words ab-- above the eh th-- th-- th--
well er you know
ca-- imagine where the forge would be on your map or it's o-- it's on mine but imagine where it would be
about two inches down from that in in between the the forge and the old pine
on the left-hand side
okay
so
where are you now
mmhmm
no no no
no
don't worry about the wheatfields it's just to tell you where to stop the line
never mind about it being an arc or a curve or anything
just just go down the left-hand side of the pine forest
okay
and once you get to the where it says pine draw a line from there to eh above the bakery but not the chimney a bit to the left of that in fact the left-hand side it must be a wee shed or whatever it is
you see what i m--
yeah
but stop when you get just to above the bakery
then just go round the bakery on the right-hand side just draw a an oval shape round the right-hand side of the bakery
yeah
right round it uh-huh
underneath the bakery
have you got a canal
no
well
the canal is about two inches to the left-hand side of the bakery but it's in line with it
so once you get an inch or and a half or so past the bakery
eh take your line down to crane bay
oh i've got two wheatfields that's not important is it right anyway w--
so you get to the canal right you don't have one but g-- just go down about two inches until you get to crane bay and follow follow the curve
okay
of crane bay
but not don't go down just go along don't go dow-- don't go down where it it really curves away there don't don't follow that
so you're at the top le-- left-hand side of crane bay right n-- just northwest of where it says crane
or the s-- where the "c" is
i've got wheatfields in line with where it says bay okay about an inch or so to the left of crane bay itself just in line in fact beneath where the other wheatfields were that i that i was telling you about
okay
so y-- you go round the round that curve and you have to go down and about an inch and a half
okay
to a-- to avoid the wheatfields which are just to the left of crane bay so you go down there
right
go beneath the wheatfields in other words draw a line you know two inches or so to the left
have you got a rocket warehouse
well
just draw a line between well above the rocket warehouse in fact
okay
an in-- an inch or so above the rocket warehouse but to the left of it go round it the same way as you went round the igloo but on the other side
okay
just follow it round
go down the left-hand side of the page once you've done that
have you got a lighthouse
the rocket warehouse
the cross is right next to the lighthouse and just take your line to there and that's it finished
on the left-hand side of it
well y--
yeah that would be okay
uh-huh and just the cross is right you know the left-hand side of the lighthouse just next to it
okay got it
right that's it finished
