okay phil
on my map i have a telephone kiosk in the bottom left-hand corner
okay the route starts above it
directly above it about on my map about half an inch from the top of the telephone kiosk
okay
it's a dotted line that moves around to the left of the k-- telephone kiosk down
passing around the left-hand side of the stone circle
yeah
yeah
well under on on my map directly under the telephone kiosk
at the right on the bottom left-hand corner of the page i have a stone circle
so if you could take your route straight down 'til about an inch above the bottom of the page
okay
then go straight straight on
horizontally about and for about another inch
yeah to the right
okay
now if you move straight up you're going to be on the left-hand side of that farmer's gate
that correct
okay
if you move straight up until you're at the top left-hand corner of the broken gate
okay
now we're going to move do you have a meadow in the bottom right-hand corner
okay
now you're going to move in a diagonal line
do you have little seagulls drawn on it
little birds
okay
no you do
well i've got five little birds on mine
okay
so if you take the middle bird
and you move up the page until you're probably about to a point that's about half an inch horizontally higher than the point you're at at the farmer's gate
okay
now if you take your route from where you are now to that point
diagonally upwards
okay we're going to move up from there to the ruined monastery
and your route's
no i don't
in a diagonal line
yeah oh that sounds that sounds like the same route that i have here
does that take you up to the top right-hand corner say of the the ruined monastery you know just off the ruined monastery
by that pa--
okay
well it's slightly diagonally northwest as you said
well that's that'd be good
no
that'd be quite good actually
yeah
we're going right up there and around the top of the ruined monastery curving round the top
oh we're coming up you're coming up on the right-hand side
and you're going over to the left-hand side and down
so it's curved down towards the west lake
up northwest
say to the top right-hand corner of the ruined monastery
okay and you're going to draw like a small arch just skimming round the outside of it
an arch
down to the left yes
okay
now you're going to keep moving downwards like in an arc
around the edge of the west lake
do you have the west lake on yours
okay
let me see
now you've skimmed an arch around the top of the ruined monastery
come down about an inch keep the keep the arc coming down for about an inch
past the bottom of the ruined monastery
okay now you're going to curve it back
do you have a stile
up to
yeah
well if you can curve it round until a point that's directly below the left-hand corner of the stile
and then move straight upwards towards the left-hand side skim round the left-hand side of the stile
yeah
you've just done one that's curved down
from the ruined monastery and you're curving back up now towards the stile
on the left-hand side of it
okay come over the top
and then once you're past the stile go straight up about two inches
okay
right at this point across t-- and down to the right-hand side of your page do you have a dead tree
well that's
possibly
yeah
above
right
yeah
on the ri-- dilect directly right across from where you are do you have a great viewpoint a drawing of a telescope i have here
yeah i've got that
i've got another one across to the right
okay
and do you have the east lake up in the top right-hand corner
where you are just now should be horizontally across from say just below the bottom right-hand tip of it that's how high you should be on the map
no
no from the ea-- the bottom right-hand corner of the east lake
okay
now you should be say about a half an inch below that only across the other side of the page
excellent
now you see where the ruined monastery is
back to the ruined monastery again
and you've got you've got an elm tree sort of just off to the right of that
okay
what we're going to do then is draw a diagonal line from where you are now
down to a point that goes around the outside of the elm tree
do you
yeah go straight through it
yeah
y-- you're going to draw a line around the outside of it so you should be underneath the dutch elm
yeah that's right
we're going to curve around the outside of the elm
okay
now
this dutch elm you have if you look across the page to the stile again
is it beneath the stile or
uh-huh
and away f-- is it about an inch away from the right-hand side of the page
oh must be the same tree i would think anyway
sounds similar
okay you're going to come around the outside of that
you'll be about an inch away from the right-hand s-- edge of the page
okay
and you're going to come back in as if you'd drawn about two thirds of a circle around the tree just about
okay
now
you don't have a telescope between you and the the east lake no
a great viewpoint
do you have any kind of marking at all
a rocket launch pad
excellent
eh no i don't have a rocket launch pad on mine
but i don't think that would be a tremendously good place to go through
right
okay
do you have east lake written on the east lake
yeah
see where the "e" is
erm if you draw a line if you are just about directly beneath that "e"
okay draw a line up to the water's edge maybe just to the right of that "e"
straight up yeah
mmhmm
until you're just like virtually on the water's edge
okay
now mark your route along the water's edge to a point that's just past the sort of bottom left-hand edge of it
okay
that's pointing
yeah
if if your line is pointing you-- you're not we're not going to take it that far but if your line is pointing towards the great viewpoint which is on the top left-hand corner
and you're still underneath the east lake then that's you
"x" marks the spot and we're finished
that's you
no that's you
