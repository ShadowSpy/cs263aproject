right greg
you've got the start with the "x"
yeah
you want to come down to about a centimetre left to the left of the haystack uh in a southwesterly direction
southeasterly direction yeah
now eh
go down about the same distance to directly south below the starting point at about just below the level of the carpenter's house so from the haystack go down to directly below the starting cross to a level just below the carpenter's house
well across from that directly below the start
so it's going to be in a southwesterly direction
what blacksmith
right
i see right
eh take the line towards well along horizontally to eh
the carpenter's got a couple of stiles
and dykes
just take it about oh i don't know about a couple of centimetres to the bottom you know a couple of cen-- eh about an inch
no not even an inch about half an inch
take it horizontally which takes you about oh about an inch and a half away from the carpenters just below where the carpenter is
just below the stiles below
take it down a centimetre and across a centimetre from the last stile to the left horizontally
right and that
have you got that
right eh
you've got green bay at the top
see green bay
no no green bay
well eh
in a northwesterly direction northeasterly direction sorry and you want a line about oh one two hchchch i would take it maybe two and a half inches northwest avoiding the carpenter's house all the way up so you want a north w-- easterly direction about dwrlr thirty five to forty degrees just below forty-five
for about two and a half inches
right eh
eh about two inches to the slightly below east next you want to go east about s-- just below east for about two inches
over towards the seven beeches
and you want to finish up about an inch high and about oh three quarters of an inch to the left of the seven beeches
eh
right
you want to come past the seven beeches
have you got the chapel
you've not got a chapel
just below well you want to come down aloalo let me see south just off south the same about the same you know how you came below east you want the same to the east of south about the same sort of about five degrees off basically
to
slightly southeast
about five degrees southeast
and you want to come across you want to come down about two inches again just below where it says eh seven beeches
well that'll be about a centimetre below the beech trees
basically yes
right on my drawing i've got a chapel that's about an inch long on the on the map it starts directly below the "s" and eh
we've got to go round this in sort of a circular direction you're going to be moving east and then back and finishing about under the second beech tree the right-hand beech tree so you want to what you want to do is you're going down about two inches again but you've got a eh a net move east of about an inch so from the "s" you've got about two inches down and one inch two inches south and about one inch east and you want to come round eh about about one inch one inch east and one inch south and do a curve
right curve it
and then you want to go in a southwest of there like direction until you meet the eh the what i ini-- what i init-- ini-- i initially said
okay
this is complicated
but what your point your initial point mark a point two inches south one inch east of the where you stopped the last time
okay have you done that yes
eh to get the curve i would go one inch down from where your your point is just now and
one inch south
and one inch east and now you want to do a curve from your initial point to that point then down to the two inch
no
it's southwest er about five ten degrees off south to the southwest to finish under the beech tree the the right-hand beech tree
going southwest
t--
well make it one and a half inch sorry one and a half inch east
you what you want to do is you want to clear the eh first movement round the chapel will have to clear the beech trees and then come down again to under the first ts on the right-hand beech tree
right
yeah
that's right yeah
and that should be just on the level of the the very end of the wee leaves on the beech trees
well i'll wait to do it until the end then
right
see what southwesterly aye
oh that's right yeah
do you have reclaimed fields
so eh
you'll be wanting to go
about an inch and a half to two inches below where you are the now
the reclaimed fields
aye see er
well what you want to do here is you want to go round it in a sort of tube like f-- form like a test tube you want to do a test tube round it
so you want to go well you're two inches down eh
well you've got
what have you got reclaimed fields and then sort of soiled ground to the right-hand side of it
whitewashed cot--
on the right-hand side
left-hand side whitewashed
eh well
we're going we're going to go round the right-hand side of it
okay
so you want to come
do you have crane bay
well what my map does it does this test tube thing round the reclaimed fields then it heads south towards the
you've got a lower right-hand tip and then you've got two tips off crane bay on the right-hand side which are just about on the same level
can you see that just above the "b" of crane bay
so i want to come round the c-- reclaimed fields and you're heading west and then you head south and you follow the line of crane bay
yeah
move down to nearer reclaimed fields
go round it
eh just past the "r" just past the the drawing of the reclaimed fields
just to the left-hand side
well don't go that far then come about an inch before it
okay that'll f-- do fine yes
have you got that
well just below that south of that there's a point just above the "b" of crane bay
a wee point
there's a sm-- a smiley face and then there's a
see if you want to come due south to that point and then follow the coast a bit
follow the coast round eh
you've got it does a curve and then it meets a point then it goes just about south crane bay it's got a curve and then it goes due south
can you see that
i've got a meadow to the left of that due south pee
porashin
a vast meadow
well is that huge big and there's nothing at all in that space
about halfway up the page
well you want to well anyway follow crane bay round the curve
goes going going
going west following the contour
until you meet just where you stop going west
and we head south we head southwest there coming out you see it goes you go just about due south then it finishes it's about an inch and a half long
and just where it finishes there come about you want to be about an inch to the west of that where you where you stop after going southwest
yeah
that's right
just about a centimetre above
the west hand
yeah
yes
and you want to follow across the top of them west
west
just below i've got a vast meadow there
eh about a centimetre after attract-- attractive cliffs
you want to go down about ten degrees off south southwest
about eh aye
about a hundred and ninety-five i would say
i've not got crashed spaceship er spaceship
and that's that's
yeah i've got the chestnut tree
that's my f-- your finishing point
that's just about on the edge of the page
yeah
yes
s-- so where are you at bottom of the attractive cliffs
the top
well you want one nine five
to the bottom of the attractive cliffs just about ah about a centimetre below the attractive cliffs
eh you've got a space craft about here
how far from the edge of the page
well eh
so can you come below it
you're going to have to come below it yes
or can you go round the top
s-- can you come south and then come slightly west then south again or can you go s-- we-- can you go west just now then south and then east to the finish
you can't go west
take it a bit more southwest until you're below it
well do that yeah do that
and you want to go south when you get about half a centimetre to the edge of the page
until the bottom of the chestnut tree
the very bottom of the chestnut tree
yeah
the bottom of the trunk of the chestnut tree
and then you want to go east along the line of the bottom of the chestnut tree to about oh half an inch away from the bottom
and then you want to go up to the the mid portion of the chestnut tree to finish just below where the the f-- eh the leaf-line starts
well you're about half an inch away from it
yeah
you want to go up like about
due north about half just where the wee bump in the tree is
and that's your finish with a big cross
yeah
there's your big cross
