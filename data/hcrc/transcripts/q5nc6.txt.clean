left-hand side of the cliffs
right got start point
right
oh you're going to do a backward "s"
okay
you're going to do a backward "s" you
right
you're going to go down slightly for about a centimetre
this is before it
i'm explaining how to do the backward "s"
s-- for a centimetre right
you're going to ehm
follow ehm a line it's diagonal it's like a five o'clock line
do you know what i'm talking about
and you're going by this time you should be just at the left-hand side at bottom of the cliffs
okay
going to do a half circle you're going to do it towards the page
mmhmm
the opposite of an indifference curve if that's the way i could explain it
okay
uh-huh
okay
right
do you have a forge
no
well
you're going to do another circle
half circle it's as if you're going round something
right
go round something imagine there's something there you're going to go round it you're going to head off towards the page
right
do a half circle and see when you come to the point just at the end of that half circle
are you at it
right
head up in a diagonal lo-- line towards a one o'clock
do you have an old pine
head up to the top of that old pine
okay
now you're going to come down again at a slight slant just a slight slant right a slight slope
you're going to come down on the right-hand side of the pine
uh-huh
you're going towards the page
right
not coming off it
right
do you have a pine forest
right
you're going to slope ehm down towards the pine pine forest but you're going to come closer closer to the pine forest when you're sloping
do you know what i mean
the gap between the path and the pine forest is getting smaller
okay
and then you should be at the bottom of the pine forest
okay
right
you're going to do another half circle towards the towards the right you're going out of the page right another half circle out of the page
uh-huh
right
so the outer circle's like s-- ehm is right across from the edge of the page okay
do you have a bakery
okay
go down slightly from that half circle just very very slightly
right
you're going to head off again towards the right and go right round that bakery
all the way round
are you at crane bay
like see the the first peak in great crane bay
are you opposite directly opposite f-- up from it
right
do that
okay
go straight down for about three centimetres
see you come to that ehm curve in the bay
you want to be about a centimetre away just from crane bay
right
follow that curve round 'til you come to the second peak
okay
are you at wheatfields
no
no
okay
right you're going to head off towards a leftward ehm slant sloping down again
about three centimetres
okay
go straight along for another three centimetres
to the left
are you above a rocket warehouse
okay
right
you're going to slants go to the end of the rocket warehouse if you know what i mean
see how the top
of the rocket warehouse
go to the end of that
uh-huh
right
slope s-- slope down again to the left directly
directly to
like you're sloping down like a seven o'clock line
okay
uh-huh
ehm
you should be about ehm six centimetres above the bottom of the page
no
you're at the left-hand side of the ro--
you should be just an inch away from the edge of the page now
right okay
go straight down again for three centimetres
and then curve towards the old lighthouse
hmm i don't have a cave
ehm go towards the lighthouse
slope towards it
you're forming another half circle again
the l-- old lighthouse
