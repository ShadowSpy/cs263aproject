right
the start is at the top left-hand side of your page
there is a diamond mine to the right
go due south to the left of the diamond mine and curve underneath it
i would go wes-- to go due east straight past it
i have a graveyard on mine
which i don't believe you have on yours
all you have to do is
you have carved stones
is go east almost to the left of the carved stones or sorry to the left of the carved stones and come up round in a big curve round the carved stones
uh-huh
so i want you to avoid the graveyard so i want you to go due east
and
due east
and then up to the left of the carved stones
that way you'll avoid the graveyard which is to the right of the diamond mine
right
i want you to go
do you have indian country
i want you to go due south until and then just go due south
not as far as indian country a couple inches above it
okay
i have a great rock on mine which i don't think you have on yours
it's to the west of indian country
so i want you to go southwest down to the left of indian country that way you should avoid the s-- the great rock so i want you to go southwest down to the left of indian country to the level of the writing indian country
alright
go due west
you ha-- also have a gold mine don't you
go west and curve round the top of the gold mine and down the other side
right
i want you to go due south
you have do you have a cavalry stockade
right
no you don't
go due south down the left-hand side of the gold mine
f-- 'til you'll
you have a trout farm
mmhmm
i want you to go three inches past that going south in other words just to the level of that i mean not the trout farm
inches three south of the level of the trout farm going due south past the gold mine
right
i want you
to curve underneath that
is that correct
and curve back up underneath the trout farm so basically you're coming in a big curve underneath your totem pole
and curving up past the trout farm
so you're below the trout farm
i want you to go due east
underneath the trout farm
across to the right of your page
about an inch in from the right of your page should do
i've got a cavalry thing which you don't have
so avoiding that i want you to go due south from where you are which is the edge of the page
down past the cattle stockade i want you to go underneath the cattle
and go west to the edge of the cattle stockade underneath it
you then have a stream down there is that correct
parched river bed
i want you to go up and above curving above that to avoid it not much just enough
i want you then to go southwest and due west underneath the bandit territory
you then curve up just above the level of the bandit territory an inch or in from your page
and that's your end
