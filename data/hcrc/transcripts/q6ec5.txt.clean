okay ehm
are you starting above the missionary camp
the bottom right-hand corner
right erm
have you got gorillas in the bottom left
right okay
well you want to go along to the end of the missionary camp left
and then down
to about four centimetres from the top of the page and then
yeah
and then go left
straight along until you get to the gorillas or the banana tree or whatever it is
and then up so that you're about
have you got a rope bridge
well
you go up and then you turn right across the rope bridge
you go over the rope bridge and then you go down straight down a couple of centimetres
have you got a waterfall
with water coming out of it yeah
well
if you just go sort of about an angle of ten degrees
oh i don't have a river
about an angle of ten degrees along so that you come to the edge of the waterfall
about the bottom
yeah
then
do you have lost steps
no
have you got fallen pillars
yeah
well
they should
above the rope bridge
well
i've got some lost steps to-- to the right of that
okay
well yeah i do
but
erm
just
between the rope bridge and the waterfall in line with the fallen pillars
so you want to come up from the waterfall
straight up
uh-huh
'til you get
to the top of them
and then you go along
yeah
about four centimetres and then you curve down so that you're going underneath the fallen pillars
now you should be at the end of the fallen pillars
and you've to go down about four centimetres
and curve round along left
no but
so you go round them
well now
if you just sort of curve round until you're in line with the fallen pillars but you're still going sort of straight up if you know
what i mean
and do you have ancient ruins
i think it's the same thing
ehm just sort of go about an angle of eighty degrees so that you're approaching that but you don't go into it you stick to the left-hand side of it
until you reach there
then in the top left there's some stones
of the map
well they're about four centimetres from the top
so you've to go straight up from the ruins to about four centimetres from the top
from about the left
and then you've to turn right
and you've got a white mountain
to the left-hand side of the white mountain
now go up one side and down the other
and underneath the white mountain there's a soft furnishings store
well
it's about the it's about three or four centimetres down from the white mountain
uh-huh
it's about the same width
ehm so if you come from the right-hand side of the mountain
along and you want to go over the soft furnishing store
well
you come down from moun-- mountain and curve round
the bottom of the mountain
until you get to the left-hand side of the white mountain
that sort of
yeah
now you're going
you have the gazelles
you're going straight down and underneath them
the right
okay erm
are you underneath the gazelles
uh-huh
just go right so that you're in line with the right-hand side of the white mountain
right
you've come down from the soft furnishing store you've come straight down
you've you've come straight down okay
from the soft furnishing store
and you've gone underneath the gaz-- gazelles and you're turning right sort of a right angle
what've you got
uh-huh
like
just over halfway
uh-huh sort of
about two thirds of the way up the page
right that's okay
that's it
