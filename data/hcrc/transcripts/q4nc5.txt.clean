right
uh-huh
uh-huh that's right
right well
what it is is it's a it's a kind of curved line right but don't draw this i'm just telling you what it is but we just drew a straight line last time it's a curved line from start in this this
right
it starts at start
right
and it stops just horizontally from ravine but it stops down from start
do you know what i mean
uh-huh
it's just on line with ravine but it's like just a curvy line and you stop just where you started
do you know what i mean it doesn't make sense does it
in fact you just wa--
uh-huh
uh-huh
just tell you what draw a straight line
okay
right
from start down to right vertical
straight down
you haven't g-- you aren't going through anything are you
where
uh-huh miss that
uh-huh
okay
and it's a vertical line yeah
yeah right that's good
and then you you draw horizontally just and stop where the "t" is of forest
okay
burnt forest
okay
and then
uh-huh that's right and then
you go up
uh-huh that's right that's good
and then horizontal
have you got a remote village
oh right
right that's right i forgot
right you know where the seagulls are
well just go up and round the ravine in a
do you know what i mean
uh-huh
no
just keep on eh zzz
uh-huh that's right
and stop at the top
right
okay
and you've not vent-- v-- have you went very far up from the ravine
right that's good that's good
right and then
uu-uu
see you go under this remote village but you've not got it ehm
uh-huh
yeah i've got that
uh-huh
uh-huh
it's just above the ravine

uh-huh that's right
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay
you go down until just underneath

uh-huh right ehm
where you've got something else haven't you underneath the pine grove
uh-huh right well--
and down
right
okay well and you've got the concealed hideout
well draw a line so you miss out the avalanche
ehm right
you miss out
right see in the line
v-- you miss out you put the concealed hideout to your right and
no wait a minute wait a minute
you put the avalanche to the right of your line and the concealed hideout to the left of your line
eh
see it's a curvy line
i don't know how i could describe this
okay then uh-huh yeah sure
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay
and you're missing out
right that's good
so it's not involved in your line like it's to the right of
your line yeah that's good and right
so draw round the concealed hideout 'cause it's actually in your line you know what i mean it's to the r-- to the left of your line
do you know what i mean
you just draw round it
just draw a wee kind of circle round it
okay
do you know where the boat house is
have you got one just

i think you you've only got one 'cause lynn only had one
is it just below concealed hideout
quite a bit down
how many
right okay
well i've got another one
right
i've got one that's ehm
right
it's to the left of the concealed hideout about a centimetre down
okay
and it's like ehm
in the what
uh-huh

right
it's just on the same level as the concealed hideout
same well kind of it's just like a centimetre down
