right
ehm the diamond mine the d-- the diamond mine is like just eh to the the the right of you there
right
now just go down beside the left-hand side of the diamond mine and eh just to below the words the first "d" there
then draw a line ehm a kind of go from there eh to just below the "s" of springboks
you don't have spri-- that's right
ehm okay right
in that case just draw a horizontal line to just below the eh to the the left of the "h" of highest viewpoint
yes horizontal right
now we're going to go round eh highest viewpoint
okay
so eh
it well we can do it in a well just go eh vertically up to the "h"
then make a curve round to the eh like a semicircle
right
eh is there anything below there
right
and eh what about safari truck
now where's the overgrown gully
eh what the midway between them
and eh to the left or right of highest viewpoint
it's directly beneath it
to the right-hand side of safari truck
right of this one right okay
okay right
so go on the outsides eh towards the paper edge ehm down to safari truck in a a slight curve
and then eh draw a diagonal line ehm from there across the top of safari truck down to field station
what is above that f--
right
well mine's eh on the same level
ehm it what what is there anything else that's in eh that's causing it to be up like that
right
right okay
well eh wh-- you're just next to the eh that what was the object you've just drawn past
right
ehm well draw eh a kind of diagonal line and then turn it
eh from right to left eh downwards
eh underneath field station
where is field station
it's the far l-- uh
well there's two field stations on my map
right
so you've only got one there
and none there in the centre right
ehm in that case you want to draw the diagonal line and then
where is banana tree
right
so eh well draw this d-- diagonal line down and then change it to a curve at the top level of banana tree and curve it round banana tree ehm with the apex of the curve pointing to the top right-hand corner sorry left-hand corner
right
if you hold it eh vertically it'll come down
is it okay now
right ehm right i'll just do the the bit at the safari truck right
draw a diagonal line from where you were
right
eh to the same just below the s-- the level of s-- the word safari truck and ab-- abou-- between banana tree and safari truck
which is slightly above eh banana tree
right
then draw a curve over banana tree ehm and curving round on it
right
and ehm now do you have gold mine between eh banana tree and rock fall at the bottom there
right
in that case eh well gold mine on my map is halfway between rock fall and banana tree
okay
it's directly below banana tree and directly above rock fall a--
and it's eh in the at the mid point of the two of that line
right
so ehm i want you to come down to two thirds of the way between eh rock fall and banana tree have
two t-- eh that's two third beneath banana tree
right ehm now there i want you to draw ehm a horizontal line to the left sorry to the right sorry eh to the right just eh so that you're on the other side of banana tree if you understand
then the rope bridge can you see that on your map
between where you are and where
right well
right
ehm are crocodiles the other side of the thing
yeah
ehm and eh the crocodile's to the right of the rope bridge
right
right and below right
ehm what i want you to do is
is there anything between the go-- eh between the where you are now and the rope bridge
right
i want you to draw a line up to the rope bridge
yes a straight line up to rope bridge so that you can cross the rope bridge the actual bridge drawing of the bridge right
now do you have giraffes at the bottom eh right-hand corner
right
i want you to eh draw round the crocodile eh on the outside of the page down to giraffes
right i want you to go underneath the giraffes
and there's any other obstacles there
right
right
is it eh bel-- is it above great lake and below g-- giraffes
right
well in that case i want you to ehm eh curve slightly up to eh just go underneath the giraffes and eh to on a level with the the word giraffes and stop there
right now i want you to eh go round the warehouse eh and under the great lake
by round i mean over like over the eh the warehouse
right and then under the great lake
is there any other obstacles there
and then come up between eh
now it's the great lake and eh rock fall halfway between them but over to the left-hand side of the page is the finish point
right
