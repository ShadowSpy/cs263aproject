uh-huh
i've got a route i've got a dotted line
but it's i don't see how it works if you haven't got for example got any pelicans
it says pelicans underneath them
amongst other indications like the big saggy bit under the beak and stuff
you know what i mean
if you haven't got the same stuff and i'd go for a big
right
the start is above the summit of the extinct volcano in the bottom right-hand corner of the page
have you got one of them
right
it says start
well you take the dotted line down to the left until it's below the volcano and you go along to the left under the tribal settlement
aha
so i 'pose you just
you go sort of off the top of the volcano sort of thing
above the volcano and then down past it on the left
and then sort of down along the page straight along the bottom of the page
a bit below it a bit below it
and then there's a there's a on mine there's a tribal settlement
right
in the bottom left-hand corner of the page
so you go round that
aye
well imagine it's there
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
after you've gone round the tribal settlement you go up and then you cross the rope bridge from left to right
okay
once you get to the other side of the rope bridge you go down about an inch and then you go straight along again towards the right and up
okay
well i suppose so aye
i haven't got a machete
but i suppose it would probably be a good idea to go round it
anyway you go down about an inch and along
to the right until you come just to the left of the collapsed shelter and go straight up past it to the left of it
if you've got a collapsed shelter
right
right so then
you go up to about the middle of the page the whole page
right
uh-huh that's must be why you go all the way up there
and i suppose you go over the top of the crevasse and down between that and the saxon barn
have you got a saxon barn
well
well i haven't got one
but i suppose you do
uh-huh
that's you know what i mean it goes up to the middle of the page to above th-- the level of the saxon barn and then it goes across towards the left over the crevasse presumably and down between that and the saxon barn and then along under the saxon barn do you see what i mean
and once you get to the other side of the saxon barn underneath it you go down about an inch to avoid the pelicans
right
uh-huh
go down about an inch and along about an inch and then back up again to the left of the pelicans if you see what i mean
right
have you got a white mountain
right
well after the invisible pelicans you go up the page and eh in slightly s-- and then past to the past the white mountain to the left of it
to the left of it
you sort of go
why behind wh--
what do you mean behind it or in front of it
you don't go through it you just go past it
uh-huh
like to the left of it
you like go go past it sort of do an outline of it to the left of it don't touch it
what do you mean round the top
mmhmm
your mountain must be different from mine
just go up the side of the page straight past the whole lot
right
so have you gone past the top of the mountain to the left of it
have you got a golden beach in the top left-hand corner of the page
well i have you don't actually go to it
you just sort of once you get past the top of the mountain go straight up but ehm leave like a couple of inches on the left and a couple of inches from the top of the page
right
and make that point a corner so that you turn to the right
and eh go along another couple inches
have you got a slate mountain
well go up the si-- up the left-hand side of it round the top and down the right-hand side of it and round the word slate mountain just sort of do a circle round it
uh-huh
until you come sort of to sort of underneath it underneath the words slate mountain
and then ehm
sort of drop down again down the middle of the page a couple of inches
why not
aye well
is that underneath the slate mountain
well go between them and the slate mountain until you get to the other side of the submerged rocks i suppose they must be under it
uh-huh
so presumably are the the submerged rocks above the secret valley
right well
go down past to the left s-- hand side of the submerged rocks
and then past the left-hand side of the secret valley
and then along the bottom of the secret valley
and that's the finish
uh-huh uh-huh
but we don't get that far
that seems to be it yeah
there you go
