we're starting er down by the bottom left-hand corner down near the bottom left-hand corner just above it
above it ab--
above the site of a forest fire
go west jus-- just to the almost the side of the paper then south down to near the bottom of the paper where there's a picnic site
you have one there
er about an inch
you go you just go west and down to about an inch off the bottom of the paper
and then you go along to the you go east about
inch off the bottom
and when you go east you go in a-- in about three inches
do you have an adventure playground
right
you go up you go south i mean you go north up past it on the on its right its left-hand side
it's just about just below it just below
it on my map
so you just go past the adventure playground on the its left-hand side
and no more
and then you just
you go east across the paper slight-- a slight angle uh just about five degrees above east across the paper to about until you're about th-- three quarters of the way across the paper there shouldn't be anything there
well there's nothing here
mmhmm well
mmhmm
right
east below it to about two thirds of the way across the paper
bit further
right okay
right your next should be going north
up where there's a
have you a granite quarry
it's ab-- it's about s-- just off the centre of the page
just slightly above it
you go up north and you curve round the top of it
until erm
well you go up pa-- you go up and round it you go north and you keep going round you sort when you get to about the word granite quarry on y-- y-- on your right-hand side of the granite quarry you are you start curving around it over the top of it
right
i've got a waterfall as well
well you curve right round it and then down so it's like a "u"-shape curve you curve round and down over the top of the granite quarry
and then
and a bit below
there i've got a train
have you got a train crossing
no no
quarry
and
below yeah about an inch below the the word waterfall
and you s-- s-- just before you get to there you sort of square off a bit
you go start going west
and then you cu-- you sort of curve round it just slightly and up past north past the waterfall
just past the waterfall
the top of the waterfall
yeah i'm
about two inches
right
you you go ea-- east just past the waterfall on the east hand side
across the top of it
right
then you're going north
you miss it by about two inches then you go
have you got cornfields at the top of the page
you go along to about the word the letter "n" below the cornfields
er about an inch and a half somewhere around there
er and then you you cut down about er southeast across the page
down to the er ha-- no
have you got fallen cairn
now you
which is about a third no it's hawe-- almost halfway down the page
and er well you cut down to below it you curve right you cut down to it and go below it
just so you're going southeast
yeah
it's just ab-- er fallen cairn's just above the quarry and to the right
yeah
you just cut down to that then go down to the bot-- round the bottom of it
yeah
so you go past it at the bottom
mm
a bit lower
you go ju-- i mean you jus-- you start cu-- actually curve right round it so you cu-- just like in a wee
so you go back up over your line you go back round just almost parallel to the one you drew to come down to it
uh-huh
i've got limestone cliffs
yeah
mmhmm
right
i've got lime stone cliffs which is the bottom right-hand corner of east lake it's below that right directly below it
er so you've gone round fallen cairn
where've you got you've you've got to
that's right
mmhmm
and you want to m-- and you've got to miss lion country
well you're fffffff
y-- you're trying to get up back up to the finish which is just between the cornfields and east lake
there's a finish just there
it's the bottom corner the bottom left-hand corner of east lake
it's about an inch to the on parallel wi-- on a a line with that but about an inch to the east west
so
and that should be about almost halfway across your page
to that to that line
and then a cut up north past the the limestone cliffs and then skirt part of east lake to the finish
you want to get north somehow
up to about
i start going parallel along i mean skirting along east lake about the line comes up to about the "a" below the "a" and where the east lake's written
and then go p-- i skirt along the lake to the finish
mm up to about the "k" whenever you can get there
uh skirt along east lake to the finish which is just
right
