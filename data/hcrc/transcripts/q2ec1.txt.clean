right
do you have sandy shore up at the top of your map
right
that's the start is just to the left of that near the coast
yeah there
okay
go south down towards the well
the well
do you not have a well
that should be just there
no
not as far south as that erm
see where this the the river comes in seems to be a bay crane bay
right
follow the line
oh hell erm my left
yeah
follow follow the line of crane bay down to just above the corner of the bay
you know how the bay goes like that
i don't have iron bridge
right
go south from the start
right
then you go left follow y-- up to oh heck go round where where the river goes
you know how the the two bits of the crane come in crane bay come in like that then into the river
well
go up to where the two bits join nearly and to form the lar the river
to the mouth of the river
right
now cut across the river at that point
okay
go over the bridge
right
now follow the line of the river right down to the fork
just above the dead tree before the fork
right
now i want you to go to your left and do a sort of "c" quite a a wide "c" round some supposed
i've got farmed land
have you got farmed land
no well do a
not again
you've cross it further down you've got to do a wide "c" just above the fork do a wide "c" so that you're coming across the river at b-- you know underneath the dead tree
right
under the dead tree go directly south for about five maybe seven centimetres
i don't have that
right
then go to your right for about the same maybe five centimetres till you come to the lagoon
do you have the lagoon
uh-huh
you should have crossed one of the
does your the river fork into one goes into the lagoon and the other one goes off the page
right okay
is your "c" on the side of the stream or on the side of the lagoon
oh heck
your river's different from mine
it and it crosses over the the mountain stream and then goes directly south underneath the dead tree
is the dead tree in between the fork
right
right
so you're going south then see i come to the lagoon then when i go south and then i go left which would me-- mean you going right
no
yes
not close at all
it's over the other side of the river
is yours on this side of the river
oh because we're looking at the same picture
right
it's like you're starting at the s-- the sandy shore
going south then going along to the right and up and crossing the river
at your bridge right you're going down to the fork of the
river
are you on the other side of the river from the the hills
right
right that's right
so at the top of just before the fork in the river do a "c" to the the same side don't don't cross the river at that point
do the do a "c" so that it
it it's like a backwards "c"
do you see what i mean
w-- round that way instead of round that way
well a back a back like do a backwards "c" there sorry
and cross the river under the dead tree for the first or the second time if you don't count if you count the one at the top
just just south of the dead tree
right
now go dead south for about five centimetres straight down from the dead tree
and then five centimetres to the left bringing you to the lagoon
right
follow the shore of the lagoon down to the tip of it at the bottom
right
do you have a rock fall
do you have green bay
right
do you see the point of green bay the top point of green bay
yes
go move to there but make it a
yes
right
take the line from the base of the lagoon from the point of the lagoon right down to the n-- most northerly point of green bay
do you have a pirate ship and the finish cross
right
now do a sort of "l" shape bringing you down to the pirate ship from where you are
going in the water
going in the water
right
that's the finish
