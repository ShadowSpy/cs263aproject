yes
and then up
straight up
yes
yes
and
you have a l-- a yacht club in the bottom right corner
slightly to the left of that you have to draw a point on a level with the c-- the top of the camera shop and then draw a straight line from the corner of the allotments to that point
no
yes
it's on a l-- it's on a level with the cam-- the roof of the camera shop horizontally and vertically slightly to the left of the c-- yacht club
you got that
then you go straight up and curve over the top of the disused monastery
have you over th-- o-- are you eh curved over the monastery
you go down to the left-hand side in this following the same curve
yeah
then at that point the curve reverses itself and dips round to a level which is vertically at the left-hand side of the alpine garden
roughly but it ends at the same line as the disused monastery in a curve that dips down from the left-hand side of it
then you go straight up to the left-hand side of the alpine garden
then to the right 'til the other side of the lef-- the alpine garden and straight up
now have you got a youth hostel marked there
no
well you go up about four inches from the alpine garden and then draw a line two inches to the right

and then you go to your right

no
there's a v-- there's a hori-- horizontal line that goes under the telephone box
eh that's on a line with the yacht club and you've to draw a diagonal line between that and the point you've just ended at
then you go up to about slightly above the top of the telephone box
then the path curves it in a follows a curve rising to the left until it reaches a line approximately level with the middle of east lake that's a ve-- a vertical line approximately the middle of east lake
yes
to a line approximately just it's below the m--
east lake it's approximately level with the the bottom of the picket fence
right and from there it's a straight line to another line which is ehm level with the top of the picket fence and the furthest most part of east lake that bulge that goes out the left-hand side
on a l-- eh the finish point is on a line level with the picket fence
about the middle of the picket fence and a vertical line that touches the outer m-- the left most part of east lake
it doesn't eh doesn't actually touch the east lake
